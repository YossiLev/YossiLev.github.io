    The Curvature of Gravitation
</div>
<div class="normal tts" id="apples">
    Apples fall to the ground, and planets orbit around the sun. Isaac Newton explained both findings, saying that
    bodies with mass attract other bodies, causing them change their speed.
    The calculation of the attraction force between mass 1 and mass 2 is given by the formula
    <span style="visibility: hidden;">. F , equals G Mass 1 times Mass 2, divided by square of the distance between the masses</span>
</div>
<div class="normal">
    \[F=\frac{GM_1M_2}{R^2}\]
</div>
<div class="normal tts" id="newTheory">
    After Albert Einstein introduced the theory of relativity, then he tried the generalize the theory to include
    accelerated motion. The result was a more general theory, to be later named "General Relativity". The theory gave
    a new explanation to both accelerations and also the attractive forces of gravity, and became the new gravity theory.
    It suggested that masses affect the "fabric of space-time" and bend (or curve or distort) it. In this space-time,
    the motion of all the stuff (massive objects but also light!)
    is distorted so they follow the curved paths in the curved space-time. A new formula gives the
    connection between "Energy-Momentum T", which is the new name for Mass, and the geometric distortion of space time,
    now called "Einstein Curvature G". Both G and T are defined at each point of space, and at each moment of time.
    The formula is ever so simple, but the simple shape is misleading.
    \[G=T\]
    In reality this equation is so complicated, that we could not solve it (except for some simple cases).
</div>
<div class="normal">
    But still, we remain with all masses curve space-time, and then masses move in space-time along the curved paths
    that are the "straightest" curves available on the curved space-time. Only when there are no masses at all
    (\(T=0\) everywhere), do we get no distortion (\(G=0\)), and then we call it zero-curvature, or flat-space.
</div>
<div class="normal">
    What is this curved space-time that makes gravity? How can we see it? This is the goal of this presentation.
    So let's start talking about curved spaces.
</div>
<div class="normal">
    <b>One dimensional curved shapes, or curved lines</b> -
    It is easy to imagine a curved line, and to tell about a line if it is curved or not (not curved would give a straight line).
</div>
<div class="normal">
    <b>Two dimensional curved shapes, or curved surface</b> -
    A curved surface is also something familiar. We can tell the difference between a curved surface and a flat one by
    looking. Look at the two surfaces below. One is curved and one is flat. Use the mouse the change view point (Guide here).
    Can you see the curvature?

    <div class="animButton" onclick="worldS.animateObject('move', [-0.002, 0, 0, 0, 0.5, 0], 'sineS', 0.5)">shift back</div>

</div>
<div class="headLine2">
    Straight lines on a curves space?
</div>
<div class="normal">
    We can imagine drawing a straight line on a flat surface, but could there be a straight line on a curved surface?
    The best way to handle this is to stand on a point of the surface and decide on which direction you want to go.
    The make a tiny step in the direction you chose. Usually, you will find yourself not exactly on the surface but rather
    a bit away. So now it is time to make a correction step and fall to the closest point of the surface.
</div>
<div class="normal">
    On a flat surface, this procedure give a path along a straight line. On a curved surface, the path is "the straightest
    line possible".
    <div class="list spreadList">
        <div class="listItem">
            See here how this works. Then, change view point and try it again.
        </div>
        <div class="listItem">
            See here several such random straight lines and compare the results of the flat and curved surfaces.
        </div>
        <div class="listItem">
            Compare the behavior of a bunch of lines that start as parallels.
        </div>
        <div class="listItem">
            Compare the behavior of a bunch of lines that start from a single point to all directions.
        </div>
        <div class="listItem">
            Change to top view and run all steps again.
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="normal">
    Some things that are special to straight lines on curved surfaces, like there could be more than
    a single straight line between the same two points, and parallel lines may meet. Such things do not depend on
    the view point so they still exist even if the we are viewing the surface from the top. From this view point
    the curvature is a bit obscured, but the straight lines continue to tell the tail of a curved surface.
</div>
<div class="normal">
    This is important, because when we start talking about a curved three-dimensional space, we do not have the
    option to directly view the curvature, by just looking at it from a higher dimensional point. So tracking
    the paths of the straight lines is a valuable option.
</div>
<div class="headLine2">
    Back to Gravitation - 4 Dimensions
</div>
<div class="normal">
    While we live in a tree-dimensional world, understanding curvature on three-dimensional spaces is not enough.
    The curved object, that drives gravity, has four dimensions. The three dimensions of space and another single
    dimension of time. Every "point" in that space is made out of 4 numbers (coordinates). Three numbers describe
    the location of the "point", while an additional number marks the time. The "point" is no longer a position,
    but rather an "event".
</div>
<div class="headLine2">
    The Geometry of Space-time
</div>
<div class="normal">
    <div class="insertImage">
        <img class="normalImage" src="../images/spaceTime.png" alt="Space Time"/>
        <div class="imageLabel">Fig #st1# - Space Time</div>
    </div>
    We want to describe space time as having a geometry. What could the picture to draw? It should display all the
    events that happen, and for each event show the location and also the time. The picture should include all
    the events of some story. For example if there is a race between a rabbit and a turtle, the could go like that.
    Both started at point A racing towards point B. The rabbit is faster, but once it got to the mid point of the race,

    it fell asleep for an hour, while the turtle continued past the rabbit and go close the the end. Then the rabbit
    woke up and continue to run but it wa too late. The whole story is shown in the following picture, with the rabbit
    path is in red and turtle gets the blue path.
</div>
<div class="normal">
    So we had concerns about understanding curvature in three dimensions, but the real target is to get to four.
    Are we lost? Not really, and that's because gravitation effects are really intuitive and easy to grasp.
