    The Curvature of Gravitation

<div class="normal" id="apples">
    Apples fall to the ground, and planets orbit around the sun. Isaac Newton explained both findings, saying that
    bodies with mass attract other bodies, causing them change their motion.
    The calculation of the attraction force between mass 1 and mass 2 is given by the formula
    <span style="visibility: hidden;">. F , equals G Mass 1 times Mass 2, divided by square of the distance between the masses</span>
</div>
<div class="normal">
    \[F=\frac{GM_1M_2}{R^2}\]
</div>
<div class="normal" id="newTheory">
    In 1905, Albert Einstein introduced the theory of relativity. He then tried to generalize the theory to include
    accelerated motion. The result was a more general theory, to be later known as "General Relativity". The theory gave
    a new explanation to both acceleration and also the attractive forces of gravity. So it became a new theory for gravity.
    It suggested that masses bend (or curve or distort) the "fabric of space-time". In this space-time,
    the motion of all the stuff (massive objects but also light!) is distorted as well,
    so they follow curved paths in the curved space-time. A new formula gives the
    connection between "Energy-Momentum T", which is the new name for Mass, and the geometric distortion of space-time,
    now called "Einstein Curvature G". Both G and T are defined at each point of space, and at each moment of time.
    The formula is ever so simple, but the simple shape is misleading. \[G=T\]
    In reality this equation is so complicated, that in most cases we are unable to solve it (except for some super simple situations).
</div>
<div class="normal">
    But still, we remain with the fact that masses curve space-time,
    and then all masses move in that curved space-time along the curved paths. These paths are the
    "straightest" curves available on the curved space-time. Only when there are no masses at all
    (\(T=0\) everywhere), do we get no distortion (\(G=0\)), and then we call it zero-curvature, or flat-space.
    In such a flat space, the "straightest" curves behave line the good old straight line that we know.
</div>
<div class="normal">
    What is this curved space-time that makes gravity? How can we visualize it? This is the goal of our presentation.
    So let's talk about curved spaces.
</div>
<div class="headLine2">
    Straight Lines on Curved Spaces
</div>
<div class="normal">
    <b>One dimensional curved shapes, or curved lines</b> -
    It is easy to imagine a curved line, and to tell about a line if it is curved or not (not curved would give a straight line).
</div>
<div class="normal">
    <b>Two dimensional curved shapes, or curved surface</b> -
    A curved surface is also something familiar. We can tell the difference between a curved surface and a flat one by
    looking. Look at the two surfaces below. One is curved and one is flat. Use the mouse the change view point (Guide here).
    Can you see the curvature?
</div>
<div class="container">
    <canvas width="1300" height="600" id="surface_Canvas" class="canvasWebGl" tabindex="0"></canvas>
   <!-- <canvas width="1000" height="600" id="surface_Canvas_Text" class="textCanvas"></canvas> -->
</div>
<div class="normal">
    We can imagine drawing a straight line on a flat surface, but could there be a straight line on a curved surface?
    The best way to handle this is to stand on a point of the surface and decide on which direction you want to go.
    The make a tiny step in the direction you chose. Usually, you will find yourself stepping out of the surface.
    So you can make a correction step and fall to the closest point of the surface.
</div>
<div class="normal">
    On a flat surface, this procedure give a path along a straight line. On a curved surface, the path is "the straightest
    line possible". Let's look at examples of such curves. Press the following buttons to put some lines on both surfaces.
    Lines start at the same point and same directions but continue differently on each surface.

</div>
<div class="normal">
    Some things that are special to straight lines on curved surfaces, like there could be more than
    a single straight line between the same two points, and parallel lines may meet. Such things do not depend on
    the view point, so they still exist even if we are viewing the surface from the top. From this view point
    the curvature is a bit obscured, but the straight lines continue to tell the tail of a curved surface.
</div>
<div class="normal">
    This is important, because when we start talking about a curved three-dimensional space, we do not have the
    option to directly view the curvature, by just looking at it from a higher dimensional point. So tracking
    the paths of the straight lines is a valuable option.
</div>
<div class="normal">
    While we live in a three-dimensional world, understanding curvature on three-dimensional spaces is not enough.
    The curved object, that drives gravity, has four dimensions. The three dimensions of space and another single
    dimension of time. Every "point" in that space is made out of 4 numbers (coordinates). Three numbers describe
    the location of the "point", while an additional number marks the time. The "point" is no longer a position,
    but rather an "event".
</div>
<div class="headLine2">
    The Geometry of Space-time
</div>
<div class="normal">
    <div class="insertImage">
        <img class="normalImage normalImageLarge" src="../images/spaceTime.png" alt="Space Time"/>
        <div class="imageLabel">Fig #st1# - Space Time</div>
    </div>
    We want to describe space-time as a geometry. What could be the picture to draw? It should display all the
    events that happen, and for each event show the location and also the time. The picture should include all
    the events of some story.
</div>
<div class="normal">
    For example if there is a race between a rabbit and a turtle, they could go like that.
    Both started at point A racing towards point B. The rabbit is faster, but once it got to the mid-point of the race,
    it fell asleep for an hour, while the turtle continued past the rabbit and go close to the end. Then the rabbit
    woke up and continued to run, but it was too late.
</div>
<div class="normal">
    The whole story is shown in the following picture. The rabbit's path is in red, and turtle gets the blue path.
    Every point on this picture can host an event, that is something that happened at a certain exact location and at
    a certain exact time.
    The horizontal coordinate of an event holds the position, that is "where", while the vertical holds the time, the "When".
    If you see that some participant in the scenario, has a vertical line, this means that while time is passing,
    position is not. This matches a participant staying put for some period of time, so no motion.
    On the other hand, we never see a horizontal line, as this would have meant a participant that appear to be at
    more than one position at the same time.
</div>
<div class="normal">
    Such a map has two dimensions, one of space and one of time, jointly called Space-Time. We see all the points on
    it (the events) and can draw lines between them. So we can treat them as if they belong to a geometry,
    using geometrical terms, like length, slope, etc. While it is two-dimensional, the usual way is to say the its
    had 1&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 (one plus one) dimensions. So we emphasize that there is one position dimension and one time dimension.
</div>
<div class="normal">
    The physical space we live in is described using three coordinates to mark the position of a certain object.
    If we want to talk of our space-time, to would have 3&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 (three plus one) dimensions. All together four dimensions.
    Let make a smaller step and talk about 2&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 dimensions. By that we mean, two dimensions of space with one dimension
    of time. Again, we meet our rabbit and turtle, but now they are free to move around on a two-dimensional space.
    So they race not from point A to point B, but rather on a circular track. The full space-time will of course be
    a three-dimensional thing (see below). The checkered floor marks the two coordinates of space, while the green
    arrow is the time coordinate, the "When".

    The Curved Space-time or Gravitation
</div>
<div class="normal">
    So we had concerns about understanding curvature in three dimensions, but the real target is to get to four.
    Are we lost? Not really, because gravitation effects are really intuitive and easy to grasp.
    All we need to do is to take what we know about how gravitation affects objects and translate it into geometry.
