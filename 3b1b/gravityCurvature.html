    The Curvature of Gravitation
</div>
<div class="normal tts" id="apples">
    Apples fall to the ground, and planets orbit around the sun. Isaac Newton explained both findings, saying that
    bodies with mass attract other bodies, causing them change their speed.
    The calculation of the attraction force between mass 1 and mass 2 is given by the formula
    <span style="visibility: hidden;">. F , equals G Mass 1 times Mass 2, divided by square of the distance between the masses</span>
</div>
<div class="normal">
    \[F=\frac{GM_1M_2}{R^2}\]
</div>
<div class="normal tts" id="newTheory">
    After Albert Einstein introduced the theory of relativity, he tried the generalize the theory to include
    accelerated motion. The result was a more general theory, to be later named "General Relativity". The theory gave
    a new explanation to both accelerations and also the attractive forces of gravity, and became the new gravity theory.
    t suggested that masses affect the "fabric of space-time" and bend (or curve or distort) it. In this space-time,
    the motion of all the stuff (massive objects but also light!)
    is distorted so they follow the curved paths in the curved space-time. A new formula gives the
    connection between "Energy-Momentum T", which is the new name for Mass, and the geometric distortion of space time,
    now called "Einstein Curvature G". Both G and T are defined at each point of space, and at each moment of time.
    The formula is ever so simple, but the simple shape is misleading.
    \[G=T\]
    In reality this equation is so complicated, that we could not solve it (except for some simple cases).
</div>
<div class="normal">
    But still, we remain with all masses curve space-time, and then masses move in space-time along the curve paths
    that are the "straightest" curves available on the curved space-time. Only when there are not masses at all (\(T=0\)),
    do we get no distortion (\(G=0\)), and then we call it zero-curvature of flat-space.
</div>
<div class="normal">
    <b>One dimensional curved shapes, or curved lines</b> -
    It is easy to imagine a curved line, and to tell about a line if it is curved or not (not curved would give a straight line).
</div>
<div class="normal">
    <b>Two dimensional curved shapes, or curved surface</b> -
    A curved surface is also something familiar. We can tell the difference between a curved surface anf a flat one by
    looking.

<div class="normal">
    We can imagine drawing a straight line on a flat surface, but could there be a straight line on a curved surface?
    The best way to handle this is to stand on a point of the surface and decide on which direction you want to go.

    The above formula mimics the gravitational “force” transforming “gravitational potential energy” into “kinetic energy”.
    We should note that according to our theory,
    the gravitated particle does not experience any force and does not change its energy.
    It is more like sound waves in the windy air as the wind changes speed.
</div>
<div class="normal">
    However, this is actually not Newton’s gravitation; it is closer to Einstein’s gravitation! Can you see why?
</div>
<div class="list spreadList">
    <div class="listItem">
        If a matter system with a clock, is simply drifting towards the main particle
        (call this gravitating particle “earth” for convenience),
        then the falling system is always at rest relative to the ether as it increases speed (free fall).
        So clock rate does not change.
        But a static object (a clock standing on the ground)
        is actually moving through the flowing ether just to stay in place.
        The circular paths of its particles become helix,
        and internal cycle time becomes longer at exactly the right amount (see appendix D).
        If another clock placed on a high tower, it will experience a slower ether wind,
        so the effect of slowing down still appears, but less slow than the clock on the ground.
        This is <b>time dilation</b> due to gravitation. In a flat world!
    </div>
    <div class="listItem">
        Another feature of the flowing ether is that it slows down free light beams traveling perpendicular to the ether flow.
        Similar to a boat crossing a flowing river losing some speed for resisting the river flow as it
        makes its way to the other side.
        With this, the new theory agrees with Einstein corrected calculation of light deviation due to gravity (see appendix).
        Remember that the Newtonian calculation of gravitated light is wrong.
    </div>
</div>
<div class="highlight">
    Gravitation happens because masses suck the ether causing a drift towards them.
</div>
<div class="normal">
    So, masses do not change the geometry of space-time; they create an inward ether wind.
    The world manifold stands still and flat!
