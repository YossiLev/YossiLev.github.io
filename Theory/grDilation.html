<div class="normal">
  We calculated the connection between ether drift speed and the distance from a gravitating object.
  \[\frac{U^2}{2}-\frac{G_NM}{R}=0\]
</div>
<div class="normal">
  So if a clock starts at rest at infinity and free falls towards the earth,
  we know that it is drifted with the ether speed, and since it has zero relative speed to the ether,
  it maintains its absolute correct time ticks.
  Another clock that sits on the ground is at rest relative to the world,
  but its speed relative to the ether is given by
  \[V^2=\frac{2GM}{R}=0\]
  The ground clock will experience clock dilation as follows
  \[\frac{T_{ground}}{T_{absolute}}=\sqrt{1-\frac{V^2}{C^2}}=\sqrt{1-\frac{2GM}{RC^2}}\]

</div>
<div class="normal">
  A bonus - as expected (and matching to the prediction of general relativity),
  there will also be a length contraction in the radial direction for ground objects at rest,
  i.e. objects that move relative to the ether.
