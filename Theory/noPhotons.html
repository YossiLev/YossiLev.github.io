<div class="normal">
    It is common to assume that light can also be viewed as made of particles – Photons.
    While EM waves sometimes present themselves as a continuous entity,
    there were some experiments that suggested that light should be quantized, that is,
    regarded as being made out of discrete balks containing discrete values of energy.
    These include the interaction (absorption and emission) of EM fields with matter particles.
    So, how can we understand such processes without quantizing the EM fields?
</div>
<div class="normal">
    We agree that the matter system (e.g. Hydrogen atom) has discrete states of stability.
    Each state has a definite value of energy, but also of angular momentum.
</div>
<div class="normal">
    Here is our interpretation of the interaction process,
    and how physics reached to the false conclusion that light is made of quantized entities.
</div>
<div class="normal">
    The interaction with light includes a transition of the matter system from one stable state into another.
    So the total change of energy \((\Delta E)\) and angular momentum \((\Delta L)\) of the system also has discrete values.
    For example, an electron changes state from values of \((E_1, L_1)\) into another state \((E_2, L_2)\).
    So the change in EM values (absorbed or emitted) is \((\Delta E, \Delta L)\).
    If the values that \(L\) can accept are discrete as follows, then we get that \(\Delta L\) is also quantized to,
    and the most popular \(\Delta L\) value is a single.
    So the light that is emitted from (or collected by) the atom has values of \((E=E_2–E_1, L=\hbar)\)
    due to conservation of energy and angular momentum.
</div>
<div class="normal">
    When light has a specific color or frequency (marked \(\omega\)),
    then every portion of space, that contains this light,
    has a specific connection between the EM energy and the EM angular momentum. This connection is (see Ohanian [3]).
    So the bulk of light emitted from (or collected by) the atom must have a specific frequency
    (or color) to fit the expected parameters \((\Delta E, \hbar)\).
    Since atoms will emit or collect EM wave only in portions that have angular momentum value of \(\hbar\),
    then it looks like the only way to transit between starts of certain \(\delta E\), is by a light of frequency \(\omega\) that goes by the rule.
    This may lead us to the false conclusion that light with color \(\omega\) is “made of” particles that have. Then we gave it a name - “Photon”,
    and then we decided that it is a point particle, and of zero mass
    (this was at least correct, as mass is the amount of trapped energy, while free light is not trapped at all).
</div>
<div class="normal">
    In reality, the bulk of light that is emitted into space (or the bulk of light that is missing from the plane wave incoming light,
    as it was scooped by the matter system in order for it to transform into a higher energy state),
    has an irregular shape and size and is definitely not a “point particle”.
</div>
<div class="normal">
    This theory claims that Electromagnetic free waves are pure wave.
    They can come at any amplitude continuous value, no discrete values, and no quantization.
    The value of Plank’s constant does not exist in EM waves, only in matter systems.
    Those matter systems are basically made of trapped waves (not free),
    so there is a vortex that has a minimal size, due to angular momentum,
    and the minimal value of that angular momentum (besides zero, that comes from two vortices
    in the same system that cancel each other’s angular momentum) is Plank’s constant.
</div>
<div class="normal">
    The Plank’s constant is relevant to EM free waves only in processes where EM wave is absorbed or emitted by matter systems.
</div>
<div class="normal">
    You may argue – “But in the two slits experiment we get discrete “clicks” on the screen and each click represents a single photon”.
    No! The click starts with a matter system (a single atom of the detector) that has transitioned from one state to another.
    This is a deterministic process between a free wave and a trapped wave,
    and depends mainly on the phase difference between the two (see more in the discussion about Gauge symmetry,
    that should actually be named Phase symmetry)
