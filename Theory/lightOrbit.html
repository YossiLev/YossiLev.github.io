  The speed of light for a beam that eventually travels perpendicular to the ether motion (with ether speed U) is \(\sqrt{C^2-U^2}\).
  We would like to understand the situation of a light beam that travels in a circular loop around a black hole,
  with light motion perpendicular to the ether motion “falling” into the black hole
  (we discuss here a Schwarzschild black hole only).
</div>
<div class="normal">
  Near a black hole we can expect to get an event horizon at a distance \(R_s=\frac{2GM}{C^2}\).
  Every light ray inside the event horizon is drifting into the center.
  We would like to calculate the location where light rays are trapped in a circular orbit,
  forever moving in a lateral direction relative to the radial speed of ether – this distance is \(R_p\).
  The speed of the ether at this distance is \(U_p=\sqrt{\frac{2GM}{R_p}}\).
  So the lateral speed of light there is calculated as \[C_p=\sqrt{C^2-U_p^2}=\sqrt{C^2-\frac{2GM}{R_p}}\]
  The radial acceleration of the light should match the ether inward acceleration (that is
  \(\frac{V^2}{R}=\frac{dU}{dt}=-\frac{d\frac{1}{2}U^2}{dR}\)). So in our case we get
  \[\frac{c_p^2}{R_p}= -\frac{d\frac{1}{2}U_p^2}{dR}\]
  and this gives us
  \[\frac{C^2-U_p^2}{R_p} = -\frac{d\frac{GM}{R_p}}{dR}\]
  \[\frac{\frac{2GM}{R_s}-\frac{2GM}{R_p}}{R_p} = \frac{GM}{R_p^2}\]
  \[\frac{2GM}{R_s}-\frac{2GM}{R_p} = \frac{GM}{R_p}\]
  \[\frac{2}{R_s} = \frac{3}{R_p}\quad \textrm{or} \quad  R_p=\frac{3}{2}R_s\]
