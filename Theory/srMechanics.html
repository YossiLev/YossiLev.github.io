  Special Relativity
</div>
<div class="normal">
  The theory of special relativity changed the way we looked at space an time.
  Before special relativity, we perceive the world as having 3 dimension (we label them x, y, z),
  this world changes as time passes (yet another parameter we label t).
</div>
<div class="normal">
  Einstein suggested a different view. He claimed:
</div>
<div class="list">
  <div class="listItem">
    I know how to treat light (the electromagnetic waves introduced by Maxwell) in a way
    that allows all observers to see light moving at the same velocity,
    even if each observer has its own relative speed.
    The way to do it is to use <b>Lorentz transformation</b> in order to translate one observer to the other.
    Once we accept that, the results of the <b>Michelson Morely experiment</b> can be understood, that is,
    you can move however you like, you will still measure the same velocity with every beam of light around you.
    Or put it more simply, you cannot race or outrun a beam of light.
  </div>
  <div class="listItem">
    However, by doing that, the different observers will not be able to agree on the normal laws of mechanics.
    So, the solution is to change tne Newtonian mechanics, than handles material objects,
    so that it becomes consistent with the way light behave.

<div class="normal">
  This led to a deep revision of what we though about things that we felt so fundamental and logical,
  like space, time, energy, and mass.
</div>
<div class="normal">
  My view is simple. Yes, matter naturally behaves like light, because <b>matter is made of light!</b>.
  So that's the real origin of special relativity.
</div>
<div class="normal">
  In some way, we've just proven special relativity, but i can't resist the joy of diving into all the details
  of how this is manifested in the full theory, so here comes the detailed explanation.

    <div class="normal">
      Mass and Energy are intuitively perceived as opposites.
      In my naive mind, I imagined mass particles as tiny spheres made of
      some tough material (like marble...), while energy seemed more like a wobbling
      wave moving around. So once I hear that energy can me absorbed by particles and add
      to their mass, it is quite difficult for me to imagine a wobbling thing approaches a piece
      of marble, disappear inside it, just to make more marble?! How can this happen. And the top
      of all absurdities, is two pieces of marble, one electron, on positron, approach each other
      and disappear into a thin wobbling something.
    </div>
    <div class="normal">
      The interpretation of modern physics to this problem is less naive, but also unsatisfactory.
      The combined world of all electrons (and positrons) in the world, resides on a sheet called
      the "Electronic Spinor Field". Forget the sphere of marble, that sheet resembles a "Spring mattress".
      The springs are made of "Iron", but in themselves, they are not electrons. Electrons are vibrations
      on that mattress (say what!?!). If we are taking about a beam of electrons. like in a particle
      accelerator, we can imagine a continuous wave crossing that mattress from side to side. But as for
      a single electron, the view is of a located stable wobbling at some place on the mattress. What
      could keep this disturbance from dispersing into its surroundings?

  \[E = MC^2 \]
  \[ \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \rightarrow \frac{D}{Dt} \equiv \frac{\partial}{\partial t}
  + U_x\frac{\partial}{\partial x} + U_y\frac{\partial}{\partial y} + U_z\frac{\partial}{\partial z} \]

  \[ \frac{DE}{Dt} =\nabla \times B \;\;\;\;\;\; \frac{DB}{Dt} = -\nabla \times E \]
  \[E_t^2 = P_M^2 + E_0^2 \]
  \[ d\tau = dt\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}} \]
