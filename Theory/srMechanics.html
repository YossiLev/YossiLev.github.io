  Special Relativity
</div>
<div class="normal">
  The theory of special relativity changed the way we looked at space an time.
  Before special relativity, we perceive the world as having 3 dimension (we label them x, y, z),
  this world changes as time passes (yet another parameter we label t).
</div>
<div class="normal">
  Einstein suggested a different view. He claimed:
</div>
<div class="list">
  <div class="listItem">
    I know how to treat light (the electromagnetic waves introduced by Maxwell) in a way
    that allows all observers to see light moving at the same velocity,
    even if each observer has its own relative speed.
    The way to do it is to use <b>Lorentz transformation</b> in order to translate one observer to the other.
    Once we accept that, the results of the <b>Michelson Morely experiment</b> can be understood, that is,
    you can move however you like, you will still measure the same velocity with every beam of light around you.
    Or put it more simply, you cannot race or outrun a beam of light.
  </div>
  <div class="listItem">
    However, by doing that, the different observers will not be able to agree on the normal laws of mechanics.
    So, the solution is to change tne Newtonian mechanics, than handles material objects,
    so that it becomes consistent with the way light behave.
  </div>
</div>
<div class="normal">
  This led to a deep revision of what we though about things that we felt so fundamental and logical,
  like space, time, energy, and mass.
</div>
<div class="headLine2">
  A new way to look at Special Relativity
</div>
<div class="normal">
  My view is simple. Yes, matter naturally behaves like light, because <b>matter is made of light!</b>.
  So that's the real origin of special relativity.
</div>
<div class="normal">
  In some way, we've just proven special relativity, but i can't resist the joy of diving into all the details
  of how this is manifested in the full theory, so here comes the detailed explanation.
</div>
<div class="headLine3">
  Time Dilation
</div>
<div class="normal">
  The most astonishing revelation that comes from the theory of special relativity is time dilation - time passes
  more slowly if an we are moving. There are several apparent contradictions that arise from time dilation, but
  Einstein was able to solve them all in a consistent manner. The price that Einstein suggest that we pay is
  to declare time itself as relative and abandon the notion of an absolute <b>common</b> time for all observers.
</div>
<div class="normal">
  The new theory claims that time itself is absolute and common, but "time measurement devices" change their behavior
  where moving against the local ether environment. This is not strange phenomenon. A pendulum acting as a time
  measurement device, is affected by the <b>acceleration</b> of the containing system (acceleration due to gravitation or
  movement). This does not make us declare time as relative as other phenomena, and indeed, other devices are not
  affected by acceleration. However, when particles move, even at constant speed, through the ether, a change in
  behavior happens at the particle level, so all our clocks slow down. Let's see how this happens.
</div>
<div class="headLine3">
  Boarding the Einstein train
</div>
<div class="normal">
  <div class="insertImage">
    <img class="normalImage" src="../images/train.png" alt="Einstein train start"/>
    <div class="imageLabel">Fig #et1# - Clocks on a train</div>
  </div>
  In a world where ether is at rest, we board a train that will move at a high speed through ether. On the train
  there are two light clocks. A light clock is made of two mirrors, with a beam of light going back and forth between
  them. We will use two clocks of this type, and position them one with the light beams moving perpendicular to the
  direction of the motion (Clock 1), and the other with the light beams moving in parallel to the train motion (Clock 2).
</div>
<div class="normal">
  We will also be looking at two electrons each one is made of a light beam moving along a circular path. One electron
  will have the rotation axis parallel to the train motion (Electron 1), the other will have its axis perpendicular to
  the train motion (Electron 2).
</div>
<div class="normal">
  So now let's put the train in motion and git it a considerable speed, like around 70% of the speed of light. At this
  state, we can see that the perpendicular light clock (Clock 1) behave differently than the clock at rest. In motion,
  the direction of the light beams is diagonal, and because the total speed of the beams remains the speed of light
  (relative to the ether), then the time it takes to complete an up down cycle is longer.
  <div class="insertImage">
    <img class="normalImage" src="../images/trainMotionClock1.png" alt="Einstein train motion clock 1"/>
    <div class="imageLabel">Fig #etc1# - Clock 1 in motion</div>
  </div>
  If we really use this device as a clock, i.e., a time measuring device the it will show a slower passage of time.
  This is obvious from the fact that light "invests" part of its speed to advance with the train, so it has less speed
  for travelling between the mirrors. The time of each cycle tick is therefore longer.

      Mass and Energy are intuitively perceived as opposites.
      In my naive mind, I imagined mass particles as tiny spheres made of
      some tough material (like marble...), while energy seemed more like a wobbling
      wave moving around. So once I hear that energy can me absorbed by particles and add
      to their mass, what I imagine is a wobbling thing approaches a piece
      of marble, disappear inside it, just to make more marble?! How can this happen. And the top
      of all absurdities, is two pieces of marble, one electron, one positron, approach each other
      and disappear into a thin wobbling something.
    </div>
    <div class="normal">
      The interpretation of modern physics to this situation is less naive, but also unsatisfactory.
      The combined world of all electrons (and positrons) in the world, resides on a sheet called
      the "Electronic Spinor Field". Forget the sphere of marble, that sheet resembles a "Spring mattress".
      The springs are made of "Iron", but in themselves, they are not electrons. Electrons are vibrations
      on that mattress (say what!?!). If we are talking about a beam of many electrons, like in a particle
      accelerator, we can imagine a continuous wave crossing that mattress from side to side. But as for
      a single electron, the view is of a located stable wobbling at some place on the mattress. What
      could keep this disturbance from dispersing into its surroundings? Well, not the whole story. There
      is another mattress, called the "Photonic Vector Field", working together with the first mattress.
      This new mattress also has its own internal pulling and pushing springs, though with different rules.
      However, there are also other springs that connect between the two mattresses. So now a single electron,
      which is a localized wobbling something on the Electronic mattress, must also create vibration in
      the Photonic mattress.

  \[ \frac{DE}{Dt} =\nabla \times B \;\;\;\;\;\; \frac{DB}{Dt} = -\nabla \times E \]
  \[E_t^2 = P_M^2 + E_0^2 \]
