  Special Relativity
</div>
<div class="normal">
  The theory of special relativity changed the way we looked at space an time.
  Before special relativity, we perceive the world as having 3 dimension (we label them x, y, z),
  this world changes as time passes (yet another parameter we label t).

<div class="normal">
  Einstein suggested a different view. He claimed:

    I know how to treat light (the electromagnetic waves introduced by Maxwell) in a way
    that allows all observers to see light moving at the same velocity,
    even if each observer has its own relative speed.
    The way to do it is to use <b>Lorentz transformation</b> in order to translate one observer to the other.
    Once we accept that, the results of the <b>Michelson Morely experiment</b> can be understood.

    However, by doing that, the different observers will not be able to agree on the normal laws of mechanics.
    So, the solution is to change tne Newtonian mechanics so that it becomes consistent with

  \[E = MC^2 \]
  \[ \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \rightarrow \frac{D}{Dt} \equiv \frac{\partial}{\partial t}
  + U_x\frac{\partial}{\partial x} + U_y\frac{\partial}{\partial y} + U_z\frac{\partial}{\partial z} \]

  \[ \frac{DE}{Dt} =\nabla \times B \;\;\;\;\;\; \frac{DB}{Dt} = -\nabla \times E \]
  \[E_t^2 = P_M^2 + E_0^2 \]
  \[ d\tau = dt\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}} \]
