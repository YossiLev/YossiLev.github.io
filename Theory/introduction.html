        The current fundamental theory of physics provides a lot of correct predictions.

            It lacks an ontology. If the reason for scientific investigation of the world is the desire to know
            how things work, and what is really happening, the physics theories with all their success do not provide
            and answer. Especially when we deal with Quantum Mechanics, or even Quantum Field Theory (QFT), it is
            quite a disappointing to realize that there is no clear description of what is happening. All we get is
            prediction like "if you prepare an experiment with so and so conditions, then the probability of each outcome
            is such and such". The is no story accompanying the experiment telling us which real objects have participated
            in the experiment and what really went on during the process. There is not even a clear description of the
            reality of the objects.

            The two main parts - General Relativity and Quantum Fields - do not mix well, and we don't have a
            reasonable idea how to merge them.

            There are various types of singularity. These cause infinities and the usual way to deal with these problems
            is to "sweep them under the rug". For infinities in the center of black hole, we usually say "our theory
            handles everything except this point, we'll get there sometime". For infinities in particle physics we
            use mathematical tricks, ignoring the need for rigorous justification, that enable us to extract predictions
            for scattering processes.

        What we promise?
    </div>
    <div class="normal">
        We will describe a different view of the world around us, and this view may be considers as a new fundamental
        physical theory.
    </div>
    <div class="normal">
        The new theory is complete, realistic, absolute, deterministic, logical, regular, and it is simple.
        What's not to like? &#128578;
    </div>
    <div class="list">
        <div class="listItem">
            <b>Complete</b> - The new theory fully describes every aspect of fundamental physics. Specifically it
            offers a unified theory seamlessly handling both gravitation and the quantum region.
        </div>
        <div class="listItem">
            <b>Realistic</b> - The new theory explains the various objects and processes and not merely give
            probabilities to observations.

            <b>Absolute</b> -
