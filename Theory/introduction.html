    Introduction

        The current fundamental theory of physics provides a lot of correct predictions. However, it is far from
        being a complete theory, and it has been a long time (roughly 50 years) that hte theory is not advancing
        towards a complete solution. Some of the problems are listed below:
    </div>
    <div class="list">
        <div class="listItem">
            The theory lacks an ontology. If the reason for scientific investigation of the world is the desire to know
            how things work, and what is really happening, the physics theories with all their success do not provide
            and answer. Especially when we deal with Quantum Mechanics, or even Quantum Field Theory (QFT), it is
            quite a disappointing to realize that there is no clear description of what is happening. All we get is
            prediction like "if you prepare an experiment with so and so conditions, then the probability of each outcome
            is such and such". The is no story accompanying the experiment telling us which real objects have participated
            in the experiment and what really went on during the process. There is not even a clear description of the
            reality of the objects.

            The two main parts - General Relativity and Quantum Fields - do not mix well, and we don't have a
            reasonable idea how to merge them.

            There are various types of singularity. These cause infinities and the usual way to deal with these problems
            is to "sweep them under the rug". For infinities in the center of black hole, we usually say "our theory
            handles everything except this point, we'll get there sometime". For infinities in particle physics we
            use mathematical tricks, ignoring the need for rigorous justification, that enable us to extract predictions
            for scattering processes.

        What we promise?
    </div>
    <div class="normal">
        We will describe a different view of the world around us, and this view may be considers as a new fundamental
        physical theory.
    </div>
    <div class="normal">
        The new theory is complete, realistic, absolute, causal, local, deterministic, logical, regular, and it is simple.
        What's not to like? &#128578;
    </div>
    <div class="list">
        <div class="listItem">
            <b>Complete</b> - The new theory fully describes every aspect of fundamental physics. Specifically it
            offers a unified theory seamlessly handling both gravitation and the quantum region.
        </div>
        <div class="listItem">
            <b>Realistic</b> - The new theory explains the various objects and processes and not merely give
            probabilities to observations.
        </div>
        <div class="listItem">
            <b>Absolute</b> - The new theory offers a description that does not depend on the observer. There is
            an absolute reality, absolute time, absolute space. While each observer may see a distorted version
            of the actual reality, there is still such single objective reality.
        </div>
        <div class="listItem">
            <b>Causal</b> - TBD
        </div>
        <div class="listItem">
            <b>Local</b> - The new theory is a local theory.
        </div>
        <div class="listItem">
            <b>Deterministic</b> - Determinism means that if you have all the information about the world at a certain time,
            you can use a theory to accurately calculate how the world will look in the future. it might be that there
            is no way to have the current full information, but the point is the the future can be calculated from the present.
            The current theory is far from being deterministic. It is probabilistic in nature. This means that even
            if you somehow know the full description of the present, the theory can only offer probability for each
            future configuration. The theory suggested here allows the full calculation of the future, while I do
            admit that I don't think we could be in a situation where we could gather all the information at a certain time.
            Still the theory is deterministic.
        </div>
        <div class="listItem">
            <b>Logical</b> - tbd
        </div>
        <div class="listItem">
            <b>Regular</b> - The description that the new theory gives come in the form of mathematical functions that
            are well behaved all over. No singularity is to be found. Specifically, I will describe black holes, big bangs,
            and subatomic particles using non-singular mathematical functions.
