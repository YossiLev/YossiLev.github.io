        The current fundamental theory of physics provides a lot of correct predictions.

            It lacks an ontology. If the reason for scientific investigation of the world is the desire to know
            how things work, and what is really happening, the physics theories with all their success do not provide
            and answer. Especially when we deal with Quantum Mechanics, or even Quantum Field Theory (QFT), it is
            quite a disappointing to realize that there is no clear description of what is happening. All we get is
            prediction like "if you prepare an experiment with so and so conditions, then the probability of each outcome
            is such and such". The is no story accompanying the experiment telling us which real objects have participated
            in the experiment and what really went on during the process. There is not even a clear description of the
            reality of the objects.

        We will describe a different view of the world around us, and this view may be considers as a new fundamental
        physical theory.

    <div class="normal">
        The new theory is complete, realistic, absolute, logical, regular, and it is simple. What's not to like? &#128578;
