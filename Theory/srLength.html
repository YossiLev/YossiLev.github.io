    What is the <b>change in shape</b> of a trapped light object, when it’s on the move?
    Instead of moving light and ether at rest, we will consider a stationary trajectory against ether wind.
</div>
<div class="normal">
    Look at the following trajectory, of a circular light object, where there is no ether wind.
    The motion of light is in the clockwise direction.
    We divided the circle into four parts with different color, so for a clockwise motion we go from blue,
    to green, to red, to yellow. <span data-canvas="speedEllipse" data-action="init" class="action">Click to see</span>

        <div><canvas class="activity" id="speedEllipse" width="700" height="350"></canvas></div>
        <div class="imageLabel">Activity #lencon1# - Speed circle</div>
    </div>
    We also added velocities of each part, where we joined the start of the velocity vectors so that all begin in the middle.
    So the blue velocity lines, pointing left, belong to the blue section of the circle.
    Each vector is tangent to the section of the circle it belongs to.
    The size of each vector is the speed of light (ether at rest) so they all have the same length.
    So the ends of all velocity vectors make a circle.
</div>
<div class="normal">
    How do the velocities change under ether wind of speed V coming from right to left?
    The vector V is just added to each velocity.
    If we do not change the ends of the velocity vectors above, but only push the beginning of the vectors by –V,
    we will get the correct velocities, as this is simple addition. Note that the velocity vectors,
    as they start at the same point, still have their ends making a circle.
</div>
<div class="normal">
    The question is what would the new trajectory, that fits the profile of the new velocities, look like?
    If we assume that the change in velocity, i.e. the acceleration vector, is pointed all the time to the same point,
    then the trajectory becomes an ellipse where the above special point is at one of its foci.
    In addition, angular velocity is constant, so it is easy to fix the trajectory.
    The result is that that particle is contracted in the direction of motion exactly as required.
</div>
<div class="normal">
    This problem is very similar to the motion of planets around the sun
    (the structure of the velocities is the same due to angular momentum conservation).
    The reader is referred to a beautiful proof (<span class="videoRef" onclick="embedVideo('xdIjYBtnvZU')">see video</span>)
