    We claim that what we recognize today as Leptons, Mesons, and Baryons are all basic particles
    (i.e. not made out of smaller sub-particles), with a common structure as follows:
    <div class="highlight">
        A particle is made of a light beam that is trapped to propagate along a closed path.
    </div>
    We will later show how and why this happens, but definitely <u>this is NOT a new rule in the game</u>.
    It will be derived from the above three postulates.
    As for quarks, or vector bosons, we don’t need those as basic particles.
    The term “photon” does not even appear in this theory (see Appendix C).
    Some properties of a system of trapped light can be easily noticed:
</div>
<div class="list spreadList">
    <div class="listItem">
        A particle is a system that can be at rest (unlike free light beams that always move)
    </div>
    <div class="listItem">
        A Particle has non-zero dimensions. No point particles!
    </div>
    <div class="listItem">
        At rest, a particle has non-zero energy (mass). No massless particles!
    </div>
    <div class="listItem">
        In most cases, a particle has non-zero angular momentum (spin)
    </div>
    <div class="listItem">
        A particle can acquire linear momentum, and move through ether at speeds lower than the speed of light
    </div>
</div>
<div class="normal">
 When the particle is in motion, its “motion linear momentum”
    \( (P_M) \)
    is added evenly to the entire beam resulting in \( E_t^2 = P_M^2 + E_0^2 \)
    just as we find in relativity theory (see Appendix A).
