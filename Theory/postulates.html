    Postulates of the new theory
</div>
<div class="normal">
    We start by presenting the physical principles of the new theory.
    These principles suggest a radical change to the way current theories describe the world.
    In a way, they go back to the viewpoint that was prevailing 150 years ago.
    However, while they hit the reader as revolutionary of even heretic, they are very simple and logical.

        <b>Postulate I – Space time is absolute, flat, and no mixture of space and time</b>
        The manifold on which our world resides is a three dimensional space that is infinite in size
        (or at least very big), independent of an observer (absolute), and has no curvature.
        Time is considered as a parameter, so it does not mix into the space coordinates.
        You can call this world “Newtonian”. This is a much more simple and naïve way to look at the
        world comparing to the relativistic “Einsteinian” way.
        This space-time manifold should also be seen as truly empty (until we add some physical entities into it),
        i.e. not filled with, or made of, quantum fluctuations, but rather made out of “Nothingness”.
    </div>
    <div class="listItem">
        <b>Postulate II – Space contains a gas like entity - Ether</b>
        Our space contains a substance we call Ether. Our ether is a gas-like physical object, made of tiny particles.
        Ether behaves like a monatomic ideal compressible gas.
        It has fluid mechanics characteristics like density, speed, temperature, pressure, and energy.
        You should not think about the ether particles as the particles from our current physical world,
        like atoms, or electrons. The ether particles belong to a lower level.
        In fact, the physical system, which we will later identify as the Electron, contains billions of ether particles.
        The ether gas is a classical entity.
        It is not relativistic, so ether particles can move at any speed
        (even much faster than the speed of light. That’s right; we’re not in Kansas anymore).
        It is also not quantum, so no probabilistic processes like spontaneous creation or annihilation.
        The particles of this gas do not act on each other with gravitation,
        the only interaction is for two particles to meet and locally exchange momentum.
        So the only rules that apply are the rules of classical fluid mechanics.
        The reader is best served by the analogy of a plain gas cloud that is released into a vacuum.
        Then treat it as it was perceived during the pre-Einstein age.
        The ether cloud of gas is not uniform in density, or pressure or speed.
        Its motion is dictated by the laws of fluid mechanics, and by existence of sources and sinks, to be introduced.

    <div class="listItem">
        <b>Postulate III – Electromagnetic fields and waves</b>
        The ether gas is the medium for an Electromagnetic field.
        This field is described by two three&#8209;dimensional vectors (E and B) that behave according to Maxwell’s equations, with some modifications.
        First, there are no electric charges in the equations (so also no electric currents).
        Second, the equations should take ether motion into account, as Electromagnetic waves are carried by the ether (similarly to sound waves in a moving bulk of air).
        So, once we are given the speed of ether at all points - \( \overline U(\overline x, t) \),
        then we should change the known Maxwell’s equations by transforming the time partial derivatives
        into the material derivatives, as follows:
        \[ \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \rightarrow \frac{D}{Dt} \equiv \frac{\partial}{\partial t}
        + U_x\frac{\partial}{\partial x} + U_y\frac{\partial}{\partial y} + U_z\frac{\partial}{\partial z} \]
        So the final Equations are (with speed of light set to 1):
        \[ \frac{DE}{Dt} =\nabla \times B \;\;\;\;\;\; \frac{DB}{Dt} = -\nabla \times E \]
        As expected, if an observer is at rest relative to the world, and the ether gas is not moving,
        then the speed of electromagnetic waves relative to the observer will be the speed of light.
        However, for an observer in motion (relative to the world, while ether is still at rest relative to the world)
        the light moves at a different speed.
        This seems to be contradicting to the results of the Michelson Morley experiments
        where the relative times of light rays going back and forth did not change as the instrument was rotated.
        We intend to fully explain that, along with other scenarios that involve motion of the ether itself.
        Another important thing to note is that due to the change
        \( \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \rightarrow \frac{D}{Dt} \) ,
        <b>the modified Maxwell’s equations are no longer globally linear</b>.
        This non&#8209;linearity may contribute to light&#8209;light interaction which is missing in the original equations.

<div class="highlight">
    The above three postulates represent the entire fundamental physics of the world!
</div>
<div class="normal">
Everything else can be derived or explained as a structure on top of this reality. The situation is similar to the way that the standard model describes the structure that we call “a Proton”. Some current theories emerge from this minimal base (like Special relativity, Gravitation, “QED/QFT”). Other current theories and concepts will be found as redundant and not fundamental while still computationally helpful, similar to current status and validity of Van der Waals forces.
Symmetry
</div>
<div class="normal">
The world that we’ve just described above displays space time symmetry. There was nothing mentioned above (and since this is all the physics then nothing additional will be introduced) that breaks the symmetry. So our world respects the P and T symmetries.
