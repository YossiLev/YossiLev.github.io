    Gravitation
</div>
<div class="normal">
    We claim that every matter particle eats up ether, acting as a sink for the ether particles.
    Since ether is a gas-like object, a matter particle decreases the ether local density,
    and thus pressure, enough to create a “wind” going into the particle.
    Again, <u>this is NOT a new rule!</u> This phenomenon will be derived.
    The rate of eating up ether, or strength of the sink, linearly depends on the mass (energy) of the particle.
    The incoming wind created by a particle affects all other entities that live in the surrounding ether,
    including free light beams and trapped light beam (other particles), pulling them into the first particle.
    This is gravitation!
</div>
<div class="normal">
    Let’s start with a simple state, having spherical symmetry.
    This requires a motionless spherically symmetric particle at the center of a spherically symmetric
    ether cloud (there is no such real particle according to our theory, but we will treat this as an approximation).
    What might be a final steady state of ether flow? Using the rules of fluid mechanics for
    “monatomic compressible ideal gas going through an isentropic flow”, we get (see Appendix B) in the final state
    \[ U_r^2R=KM \]
</div>
<div class="normal">
Here, \( U_r \) is the inwards radial ether speed, and \( M \) is the mass or the gravitating particle
    (connected to the rate of eating up ether) and \( K \) is some constant.
</div>
<div class="normal">
    This immediately gives us the correct gravitation!
    Other particles are drifted (carried by the wind) into our particle with increasing speed,
    and we get Newton’s gravitation attraction rule (actually it is the same as Einstein’s gravitation rule),
    as setting \( K \) to be \( 2G \) gives the following:
    <div class="equHolder"> \( U_r^2R=2GM \)<div class="equLabel" id="gr_u2re2gm">equ</div></div>
    \[ \frac{U_r^2}{2}=\frac{2GM}{R} \]
    \[ \frac{mU_r^2}{2}-\frac{2GMm}{R}=0\]
</div>
<div class="normal">
    The above formula mimics the gravitational “force” transforming “gravitational potential energy” into “kinetic energy”.
    We should note that according to our theory,
    the gravitated particle does not experience any force and does not change its energy.
    It is more like sound waves in the windy air as the wind changes speed.
</div>
<div class="normal">
    However, this is actually not Newton’s gravitation; it is closer to Einstein’s gravitation! Can you see why?
</div>
<div class="list spreadList">
    <div class="listItem">
        If a matter system with a clock, is simply drifting towards the main particle
        (call this gravitating particle “earth” for convenience),
        then the falling system is always at rest relative to the ether as it increases speed (free fall).
        So clock rate does not change.
        But a static object (a clock standing on the ground)
        is actually moving through the flowing ether just to stay in place.
        The circular paths of its particles become helix,
        and internal cycle time becomes longer at exactly the right amount (see appendix D).
        If another clock placed on a high tower, it will experience a slower ether wind,
        so the effect of slowing down still appears, but less slow than the clock on the ground.
        This is <b>time dilation</b> due to gravitation. In a flat world!
    </div>
    <div class="listItem">
        Another feature of the flowing ether is that it slows down free light beams traveling perpendicular to the ether flow.
        Similar to a boat crossing a flowing river losing some speed for resisting the river flow as it
        makes its way to the other side.
        With this, the new theory agrees with Einstein corrected calculation of light deviation due to gravity (see appendix).
        Remember that the Newtonian calculation of gravitated light is wrong.
    </div>
</div>
<div class="highlight">
    Gravitation happens because masses suck the ether causing a drift towards them.
</div>
<div class="normal">
    So, masses do not change the geometry of space-time; they create an inward ether wind.
    The world manifold stands still and flat!
