**You:**

in QED, i understand that electrons exchange momentum be "shooting" photons between the. but why do two electrons repel (momentum added to each other make them move away), while and electron and a positron attract, how are the exchanged photons differ in both cases?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

In QED the **same photon field mediates both attraction and repulsion**.  
The difference between **electron–electron repulsion** and **electron–positron attraction** does **not** come from different photons being exchanged.  
It comes entirely from **the signs of the charges at the interaction vertices**.

Let me break it down cleanly and physically.

---

# ✔ 1. What is being exchanged?

In QED, charged particles interact by exchanging **virtual photons**.  
A virtual photon line in a Feynman diagram has a propagator:

$$D_{\mu\nu}(q) = \frac{-i g_{\mu\nu}}{q^2+i\epsilon}.$$

This is the **same** for any charged-particle interaction.

There is **no difference** in the propagator (no “attractive photon” vs “repulsive photon”).

---

# ✔ 2. The only thing that changes: the vertex factor

Every coupling of a charged particle to the photon field contributes a factor

$$-ie\,\gamma^\mu$$

for a particle with electric charge $-e$ (the electron).

For a particle with charge $+e$ (the positron), the vertex contributes

$$+i\,e\,\gamma^\mu$$

because the coupling constant changes sign with the charge.

Thus:

* **electron–electron:** both vertices contribute $-ie$  
    → product of vertices: $$(-ie)(-ie) = (-i)^2 e^2 = - e^2$$
* **electron–positron:** one vertex is $-ie$, the other is $+ie$  
    → product of vertices: $$(-ie)(+ie) = (-i)(i)e^2 = + e^2$$

The **sign flips**.

---

# ✔ 3. How does this lead to attraction or repulsion?

Let’s look at the nonrelativistic limit (static forces).  
The amplitude between two charges is, schematically:

$$\mathcal{M} \propto \frac{(\text{charge}_1)(\text{charge}_2)}{q^2}.$$

Fourier transforming to real space gives the Coulomb potential:

$$V(r) \propto \frac{(\text{charge}_1)(\text{charge}_2)}{r}.$$

So:

* **Electron–electron:** $$(-e)(-e) = +e^2 \quad\Rightarrow V(r) >0$$ → **repulsive potential**.
* **Electron–positron:** $$(-e)(+e) = -e^2 \quad\Rightarrow V(r) <0$$ → **attractive potential**.

The **only** change is the sign of the product of charges at the two vertices.

---

# ✔ 4. But how can the same photon produce opposite forces?

Because **forces are not in the photon**—forces appear only after combining:

1. vertex factor of particle 1
2. photon propagator
3. vertex factor of particle 2

The propagator is **always the same**.  
The force direction comes from the **sign of the charges**.

You may think of it like this:

* The photon says: “Here is a momentum transfer $q$.”
* The _particle–photon coupling_ says: “Multiply this by my charge.”

Two like charges both multiply by −e → effectively flipping the sign twice → repulsion.  
Opposite charges multiply by opposite signs → one flip → attraction.

---

# ✔ 5. Momentum picture: why do they move apart or together?

Imagine scattering in the center-of-mass frame.

## Electron–electron:

Both emit and absorb photons with the **same sign** of coupling → the momentum kicks point **away** from each other → net **repulsion**.

## Electron–positron:

One vertex has reversed sign → the momentum kicks point **toward** each other → net **attraction**.

The exchanged photon is the same; what changes is how each charge responds to that momentum due to the sign of $e$.

---

# ✔ Final Summary

* QED uses _one_ type of photon; no “attractive photon” or “repulsive photon.”
* Forces come from the **sign of the charges** at the interaction vertices.
* The photon propagator is identical in all cases.
* Coulomb’s law emerges from the product of the charges: $$V(r) \propto \frac{q_1 q_2}{r}.$$

So electrons repel, electron–positron pairs attract, purely because their **coupling to the photon field has opposite signs**, not because different photons are exchanged.

---

If you want, I can show you the explicit tree-level scattering calculation for Møller (e⁻e⁻) vs Bhabha (e⁻e⁺) scattering to see the sign flip in the amplitude.

* * *

**You:**

that does not look right. the "e" is a coupling constant and has no sign. electron and positrons are exitations that live on the same field. i heard a different explanation that is related to the left-right circular polarization of the photon each particle can emit and absorb

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Nice — good pushback. You’re right to be suspicious of sloppy wording. Let me sort the bookkeeping and the physics cleanly.

---

## 1) About the sign of “e”

When people say “$e$” they often mean the **magnitude** of the electron charge (a positive number, $e>0$). The **sign** of the charge appears in which excitation of the fermion field we’re talking about: an **electron** carries charge $-e$, a **positron** carries charge $+e$. So it’s correct that $e$ itself is positive; the **product** of charges ($q_1 q_2$) is what can be positive or negative and determines attraction vs repulsion.

You can phrase the interaction either as

* a single coupling constant $e$ together with a charge label $q=\pm1$, or
* as the coupling constant $\tilde e$ that already includes the sign (convention dependent).  
    Both descriptions are equivalent; what matters physically is the sign of the product of the two charges.

---

## 2) Clean, gauge-invariant statement (how sign enters in amplitudes)

In QED the tree-level amplitude for single-photon exchange between two currents is

$$\mathcal{M} = j_1^\mu(q)\,D_{\mu\nu}(q)\,j_2^\nu(-q)$$

where $D_{\mu\nu}(q)$ is the photon propagator and $j^\mu$ are the electromagnetic currents of the particles. The current operator contains the charge:

$$j^\mu(x)=q\,e\,\bar\psi(x)\gamma^\mu\psi(x),$$

where $q=\pm1$ labels the sign of the particle’s charge (electron $q=-1$, positron $q=+1$) and $e>0$ is the coupling magnitude. So the amplitude contains a factor $q_1 q_2 e^2$. In the static, nonrelativistic limit the time components dominate and you get

$$\mathcal{M}\sim \frac{q_1 q_2 e^2}{\mathbf{q}^2}$$

which Fourier-transforms to the Coulomb potential

$$V(r)\propto \frac{q_1 q_2 e^2}{r}.$$

Thus the _sign_ of the force comes from the product $q_1 q_2$ — i.e. whether the two excitations of the fermion field carry the same or opposite charge.

---

## 3) Why the “polarization/helicity of the photon” explanation is misleading

You mentioned an alternative explanation involving left/right circular polarization (photon helicity). That idea sometimes appears in popular or semi-classical descriptions, but it **doesn’t** explain the static Coulomb force:

* **Real, on-shell photons** (radiation) have two physical transverse polarizations (helicities ±1). Their polarization matters for emission patterns, selection rules, angular momentum, spin–spin forces, etc.
* **The Coulomb force** (electrostatic attraction/repulsion) is dominated by exchange of the **time component** $A^0$ (or, in covariant language, by the longitudinal / scalar part of the virtual photon propagator in the Coulomb gauge). These components are _not_ the physical transverse helicity states of real photons. They are virtual components of the gauge field and do the job of producing the instantaneous $1/r$ potential in the nonrelativistic limit.
* Virtual photons can carry any polarization structure allowed by the propagator; you cannot restrict the exchanged virtual photon to be a physical transverse helicity eigenstate. So the idea “left-handed photon causes repulsion, right-handed causes attraction” is not an accurate way to think about static Coulomb forces.

In short: **photon helicity explains spin-dependent forces and radiation properties**, but the sign of the static force is fixed by the sign of the sources (the charges) appearing in the current $j^\mu$, not by which transverse helicity state happens to be exchanged.

---

## 4) Another intuitive viewpoint (field–source picture)

A helpful physical picture is: a charge is a source/sink for the electromagnetic field (it sources the scalar potential $A^0$). Two like sources produce the field configuration whose energy is minimized when the sources are farther apart — hence repulsion; opposite sources produce configurations whose energy is minimized when they come together — hence attraction. That statement is equivalent to the $q_1 q_2$ sign in the previous formula, and it’s a classical limit of the same QED result.

---

## 5) Quick remark on Feynman rules and vertices

Practically, in scattering calculations you often see the vertex factor written as $-ie\gamma^\mu$. That is fine provided your external states and field conventions are set up correctly — the sign/charge information shows up in the external spinors and in whether the external line is a particle or antiparticle (arrow directions, etc.). The bottom line: the algebra always produces the factor proportional to $q_1 q_2 e^2$ that controls the sign of the potential.

---

## TL;DR

* $e$ is usually the positive coupling magnitude; the **sign** comes from whether the excitation carries $+e$ or $-e$.
* The Coulomb sign arises from the product $q_1 q_2$ in $j_1^\mu D_{\mu\nu} j_2^\nu$, not from exchanging different kinds of photons.
* Photon _polarization/helicity_ matters for real-photon processes and spin-dependent interactions, but **not** for the basic sign of the static Coulomb force, which comes from the time/longitudinal components of the virtual photon propagator and the sign of the charge sources.

If you want, I can:

* show the short derivation starting from $j_1^\mu D_{\mu\nu} j_2^\nu$ and taking the static limit (so you can see explicitly how $q_1 q_2$ appears), **or**
* explain how spin-dependent (magnetic) interactions do depend on transverse photon polarization, to show where helicity actually matters. Which would you prefer?

* * *

**You:**

here is an explanation for coulomb force. an electron is always emitting and absorbing left handed photon in all directions. emitted photons usually end up in the EM condensation. also the condensation shoots back photons at the electron. the electron absorbs the left handed ones and ignores the right handed. for the positron is the other way round, its "language" for emission and absorption is right handed photons. when two electrons com near by, some photons from each electrons hit and absorbed by the other causing repulsion. same for two positrons. however is and electron and a positron are nearby, the let handed photons from the electron "obscure", "interfere" "destroy" the right handed condensation photons making the condensation press more from one side, and bringing the positron towards the electron, same happens the other way, the electron is attracted by the positron. 

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Let me analyze your explanation carefully and tell you **what parts match real QED** and **what parts don’t**, and then give the closest _correct_ picture that preserves the spirit of what you’re trying to describe.

Your description:

* electrons emit/absorb left-handed photons only
* positrons emit/absorb right-handed photons
* a kind of “EM condensation” (background) sends photons back
* like-handed photons from one particle get absorbed by another → repulsion
* opposite-handed photons interfere or obscure each other → attraction

This is imaginative and has some superficial resemblance to _chiral couplings_ in other theories (like the weak interaction), **but it does not describe QED**.

Below is a breakdown and then a corrected, physically consistent version preserving your _intuitive idea_ as much as possible.

---

# ❌ What is incorrect for QED

## 1. **Electrons do _not_ emit only left-handed photons**

In QED:

* The coupling is **spin-independent**.
* The photon couples to charge via $j^\mu A_\mu$.
* All photon polarizations participate: transverse ± helicities **and** virtual scalar/longitudinal components.

There is no built-in chirality preference.  
An electron emits both helicities depending on kinematics.

**The weak force** is chiral (left-handed), but **QED is not.**

---

## 2. **Positrons do not couple to opposite-helicity photons**

Electron vs positron differ **only by charge sign**, not by left/right helicity sensitivity.

Their spin structures are exactly the same (Dirac equation with charge flipped).

---

## 3. **No “EM condensation” exists in QED**

This sounds like a metaphor for the vacuum, but the QED vacuum does **not** shoot back different photons depending on helicity in a way that generates Coulomb forces.

The Coulomb force comes from the **time-like component of the photon propagator**, not from physically propagating helicity-1 photons.

---

## 4. **Coulomb forces are dominated by virtual longitudinal/scalar photon exchange**

A static electric field is described by $A^0$, not by helicity ±1 photons.  
The exchanged “photon” is not a physical radiation photon with a definite helicity; it is a **virtual, off-shell** field component.

So the language of “left-handed vs right-handed photons” cannot describe static attraction/repulsion.

---

# ✔ Why your intuition _sounds_ right (and where it actually works)

There _is_ a kernel of truth in your thinking:

### 🟢 In _some_ gauge theories, force sign _can_ be understood by polarization selection.

This is true in:

* chiral gauge theories (weak interaction)
* certain Yukawa couplings
* some models of emergent gauge fields in condensed matter

In those theories, left/right couplings change force signs or suppress certain interactions.

But **QED is fundamentally different**: photon coupling is vector-like, not chiral.

---

# ✔ The closest correct QED explanation that fits your intuition

Here is a version that is consistent with actual QED **but maintains your metaphor**:

---

## **Correct picture (QED) with your intuitive language adjusted**

### 1. Every charge creates a disturbance in the electromagnetic field

This disturbance is not a stream of left/right real photons, but a **virtual field** described by $A^0$ and the longitudinal part of the propagator.

### 2. Electrons and positrons couple with opposite sign to this field

* electron: couples as $-e j^\mu A_\mu$
* positron: effectively as $+e j^\mu A_\mu$

This opposite sign is the _only_ origin of attraction vs repulsion.

### 3. The field disturbance acts as a pressure pattern

The “virtual photon cloud” (really, the Coulomb field) around a charge acts as something like a pressure gradient:

* two electrons produce fields that **push each other apart**
* an electron and positron produce fields that **neutralize in between and push from outside inward → attraction**

This matches the idea you expressed with “obscuring/interfering background photons”, but in QED it is:

* destructive field superposition (opposite signs) → attraction
* constructive field superposition (same signs) → repulsion

### 4. No helicity structure is needed; only field superposition and charge sign

If we strip away the helicity language but keep the rest of your intuition, the explanation becomes:

> Like charges produce fields of the same sign; the fields reinforce each other between the charges, increasing field energy and pushing the particles apart.
> 
> Opposite charges produce fields of opposite sign; fields cancel between the charges, lowering energy and pulling the particles together.

This captures the **exact QED mechanism** (via the sign of the propagator contribution), but uses intuitive field-pressure language similar to what you proposed.

---

# ✔ Summary

Your explanation is **not** correct for QED because:

* QED is not chiral (photon helicity is irrelevant for static forces)
* electrons do not emit only left-handed photons
* positrons do not emit opposite-handed photons
* Coulomb force comes from virtual $A^0$/longitudinal components, not real helicity-1 photons

However, the _spirit_ of your explanation — forces arising from interference of field disturbances — **is right**, but helicity must be removed and replaced by **sign of the field** (i.e., electric charge).

---

If you'd like, I can:

1. Rewrite your explanation in **fully correct QED vocabulary**, preserving intuition.
2. Show explicitly how Coulomb attraction/repulsion comes from the Feynman propagator.
3. Show how helicity _does_ matter in other interactions (weak force, spin-spin forces).

Which would you prefer?

* * *

**You:**

in my model the electron is a toroidal ring with negative helicity flow in side it and left handed wave coming in and out to maintain the ring flow. the positron is just a mirror image of that. for positive helicity torus and right handed wave interaction in and out. the the charge is not a +/- label, it is a geometrical consequence from the helicities of the flows. I understand the this is not QED, and my particles are not points particles but have a structure.

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Understood — now that you're describing _your own internal model_, not QED, we can treat it on its own terms.

Let me restate what you propose:

* **Electron**: a toroidal structure with an internal negative-helicity flow (left-handed circulation), sustained by left-handed waves entering and exiting the torus.
* **Positron**: mirror-image torus, internal positive-helicity flow (right-handed circulation) sustained by right-handed waves.
* **Charge** is not an assigned label but an emergent geometric property: left-handed = “negative,” right-handed = “positive.”
* Interaction forces come from interference/shielding/matching of handedness between the waves emitted by each particle and the background field.

This is not QED — and that’s fine.  
The question becomes: **Is your model internally consistent? What would it predict?**  
Let me analyze it **using your own assumptions**, not QED, and show how attraction/repulsion would emerge.

---

# ✅ 1. Your model as a chirality-based interaction theory

Your universe has:

* Two types of toroidal soliton-like excitations.
* Each has a _helical internal flow_ (left or right).
* Each sustains itself via an exchange of circularly polarized waves with a surrounding background medium.

Let’s call the wavefield $W$, with two polarizations:

* $W_L$: left-handed wave
* $W_R$: right-handed wave

Particles interact by:

1. **Emission/absorption rules**
    * Electron: emits $W_L$, absorbs $W_L$, transparent to $W_R$
    * Positron: emits $W_R$, absorbs $W_R$, transparent to $W_L$
2. **Background “condensation”**  
    The vacuum floods every point isotropically with $W_L$ and $W_R$ waves.  
    (This is similar to a stochastic background or zero-point field.)
3. **Force mechanism**
    * Absorbing more wave momentum from one side than the other gives a _push_.
    * Interference of waves of different handedness produces “shadowing” or “clear regions” of the background field.

This is basically a **chiral wave scattering model**.

---

# ✅ 2. Deriving repulsion between two electrons

Two electrons nearby:

* Each emits $W_L$.
* Each absorbs only $W_L$.

**Near electron A:**

* Background contains isotropic $W_L$.
* Electron B also emits extra $W_L$ toward A.
* A absorbs these photons; every absorbed wave packet transfers momentum to A.
* Direction of absorbed wave momentum is _from B toward A_, so A gets pushed **away from B**.

Same symmetrically for B.

➡ **Repulsion naturally emerges**  
because same-chirality waves are mutually absorbable and carry momentum.

This is mechanically consistent.

---

# ✅ 3. Deriving attraction between electron and positron

Electron emits $W_L$.  
Positron emits $W_R$.

But now:

* The electron _cannot_ absorb $W_R$.
* The positron _cannot_ absorb $W_L$.

Thus, **neither particle directly absorbs the other’s emitted waves**, so no direct momentum transfer happens.

Instead, you propose a different effect:

### 👉 “Opposite helicity waves interfere and obscure the background waves”

Let’s formalize that:

* The background contains both $W_L$ and $W_R$.
* In the region **between** the electron and positron, their emitted waves overlap.
* Because the helicities differ, the waves do not simply add; they can form standing patterns or partial cancellations of the background.
* This reduces the density or intensity of the background waves in that region.

Since the background normally pushes **equally from all sides**, a reduction between the particles creates:

* A net pressure from outside pushing them inward.

➡ **Attraction emerges from anisotropy of background wave pressure**  
(very similar to the Casimir effect or LeSage gravity style arguments).

This is logically consistent **within your model’s rules**.

---

# ✅ 4. Interpreting “charge” in your model

You propose:

> charge is not ± but a geometrical consequence of helicity

This is quite natural:  
Your “charge” is a topological (or at least geometric) invariant of the toroidal field configuration.

This is reminiscent of:

* Hopfion-like solitons
* Skyrmions
* Knot solitons
* Bilson-Thompson’s braid/topological models of fermions
* Chirality-based emergent electrodynamics in condensed matter

Nothing inconsistent about that.

---

# ✅ 5. What would your model need to become predictive?

If you want this model to resemble a real physical theory, you would need:

### 1. A governing wave equation for $W_L$ and $W_R$

Something like two coupled chiral wave equations.

### 2. A stability condition for the toroidal solitons

Probably requiring:

* circulating energy flow
* quantized angular momentum (spin)
* topological conservation

### 3. A way to compute the wave background pressure

This would give explicit formulas for:

* force between charges
* field lines emerging from geometry
* relationship between helicity flow and “charge density”

### 4. Emergence of inverse-square force law

You’d need to show that:

* wave intensity ∝ 1/r²
* absorption/shadowing produces F ∝ 1/r²

Given symmetric emission of waves, this is plausible.

### 5. A way to handle spin orientation and magnetic fields

Because helicity-based models naturally interact with spin.

---

# ✅ 6. A very important point: your model is NOT ruled out by QED automatically

Since you're not claiming it _is_ QED, you're allowed different assumptions.

Many alternative particle models assume:

* solitons
* chiral internal circulation
* emergent charges
* fields as structured media

As long as you’re aiming for:

* a toy model
* a conceptual reinterpretation
* or a hidden-variable substrate

this is valid to explore.

---

# ✔ If you want, I can help you:

1. **Formalize your model mathematically:**
    * write wave equations
    * derive forces
    * show attraction/repulsion
2. **Analyze stability of your toroidal soliton.**
3. **Show what Maxwell-like field equations emerge.**
4. **Explain how spin and magnetic interactions fit in.**
5. **Compare your model with known topological soliton theories**, so you can develop it more rigorously.

Just tell me which direction you want to go.

* * *

**You:**

I think it is known how to emerge Maxwell like equations, from fluid flow. The A vector matches the fluid speed, E and B are the Lamb vector and Vorticity. however, my model will require E to be a pseudo vector by mixing the helicity inside so E is H*L (helicity times Lamb) with B as H*W (a real vector not pseudo). so a mirror transformation will turn electrons to positrons (reverse charge, which is the helicity. change emitted and absorbed photons handedness, and reverse "electric field"). I want you to try to find equations for the H*L and H*B to be similar to maxwell's equations

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Nice — this is a neat, concrete project. Below I’ll take your identifications seriously and work out **vector-field identities** and **evolution equations** that show exactly how the combinations

$$\mathbf{E}_H \equiv H\,\mathbf{L},\qquad  
\mathbf{B}_H \equiv H\,\boldsymbol{\omega}$$

(with the usual fluid notation below) behave and how close they can be made to Maxwell’s equations.

I’ll state assumptions up front, then do the algebra (keeps everything explicit), show the resulting “Maxwell-like” system and identify the extra source / correction terms that appear when the helicity $H$ is not constant. Finally I’ll point out simple limits (when your fields _exactly_ satisfy Maxwell-like equations) and suggest next steps.

---

## Notation & assumptions

* $\mathbf{v}(\mathbf{x},t)$ — fluid velocity (this is your vector potential $\mathbf{A}$ analogue).
* $\boldsymbol{\omega}=\nabla\times\mathbf{v}$ — vorticity (Lamb’s $\mathbf{W}$ in your notation).
* $\mathbf{L}=\boldsymbol{\omega}\times\mathbf{v}$ — Lamb vector.
* $H(\mathbf{x},t)=\mathbf{v}\cdot\boldsymbol{\omega}$ — helicity density (a pseudoscalar).
* Define the fields you want to treat as ``electromagnetic’’: $$\boxed{\mathbf{E}_H(\mathbf{x},t)=H\,\mathbf{L},\qquad  
    \mathbf{B}_H(\mathbf{x},t)=H\,\boldsymbol{\omega}}$$
* Assume incompressible flow for simplicity ($\nabla\!\cdot\!\mathbf{v}=0$). Also use the inviscid vorticity equation when useful: $$\frac{\partial\boldsymbol{\omega}}{\partial t} = \nabla\times(\mathbf{v}\times\boldsymbol{\omega}) = -\nabla\times\mathbf{L}.$$ (If viscosity $\nu$ is included, add $\nu\nabla^2\boldsymbol{\omega}$ on the RHS; I’ll note where that would appear.)

All vector identities I use are standard (product rule, $\nabla\cdot(\nabla\times\cdot)=0$, $\nabla\times(\nabla\times\mathbf{a})=\nabla(\nabla\cdot\mathbf{a})-\nabla^2\mathbf{a}$, and $\nabla\cdot(\mathbf{A}\times\mathbf{B})=\mathbf{B}\cdot(\nabla\times\mathbf{A})-\mathbf{A}\cdot(\nabla\times\mathbf{B})$).

---

## 1) Divergence of $\mathbf{B}_H$ — Gauss-like law

Compute

$$\nabla\!\cdot\mathbf{B}_H = \nabla\!\cdot(H\boldsymbol{\omega})  
= \boldsymbol{\omega}\!\cdot\!\nabla H + H\,\nabla\!\cdot\boldsymbol{\omega}.$$

But $\nabla\!\cdot\boldsymbol{\omega}= \nabla\!\cdot(\nabla\times\mathbf{v})=0$. Hence

$$\boxed{\nabla\!\cdot\mathbf{B}_H = \boldsymbol{\omega}\!\cdot\!\nabla H\;=\;:\rho_H}$$

So **$\nabla\cdot\mathbf{B}_H$ need not vanish** unless $H$ is uniform. The term $\rho_H$ plays the role of an effective “magnetic charge density” sourced by _gradients of helicity along the vorticity_.

---

## 2) Faraday-like law: $\nabla\times\mathbf{E}_H = -\partial_t\mathbf{B}_H + \dots$

Start with

$$\nabla\times\mathbf{E}_H = \nabla\times(H\mathbf{L})  
= \nabla H\times\mathbf{L} + H\,\nabla\times\mathbf{L}.$$

Use the vorticity evolution identity $\nabla\times\mathbf{L} = -\partial_t\boldsymbol{\omega}$ (from $\partial_t\boldsymbol{\omega}=\nabla\times(\mathbf{v}\times\boldsymbol{\omega})=\nabla\times(-\mathbf{L})$). Then

$$\nabla\times\mathbf{E}_H = \nabla H\times\mathbf{L} - H\,\partial_t\boldsymbol{\omega}.$$

Compare with $-\partial_t\mathbf{B}_H = -\partial_t(H\boldsymbol{\omega}) = -\boldsymbol{\omega}\,\partial_t H - H\,\partial_t\boldsymbol{\omega}$. Subtracting, we get the extra source:

$$\nabla\times\mathbf{E}_H + \partial_t\mathbf{B}_H =\nabla H\times\mathbf{L}$$

Thus

$$\boxed{\;  
\nabla\times\mathbf{E}_H = -\partial_t\mathbf{B}_H + \big(\nabla H\times\mathbf{L} + \boldsymbol{\omega}\,\partial_t H\big)\;}$$

The terms in parentheses vanish if $H$ is constant in space and time. They quantify how spatial and temporal helicity variations break the exact Faraday form.

---

## 3) Gauss-like law for $\mathbf{E}_H$: $\nabla\!\cdot\mathbf{E}_H$

$$\nabla\!\cdot\mathbf{E}_H = \nabla\!\cdot(H\mathbf{L})  
= \mathbf{L}\!\cdot\!\nabla H + H\,\nabla\!\cdot\mathbf{L}.$$

We can expand $\nabla\!\cdot\mathbf{L}$ with the identity $\nabla\!\cdot(\mathbf{A}\times\mathbf{B}) = \mathbf{B}\!\cdot\!(\nabla\times\mathbf{A}) - \mathbf{A}\!\cdot\!(\nabla\times\mathbf{B})$. With $\mathbf{L}=\boldsymbol{\omega}\times\mathbf{v}$:

$$\nabla\!\cdot\mathbf{L} = \mathbf{v}\!\cdot\!(\nabla\times\boldsymbol{\omega}) - \boldsymbol{\omega}\!\cdot\!(\nabla\times\mathbf{v})  
= \mathbf{v}\!\cdot\!(\nabla\times\boldsymbol{\omega}) - |\boldsymbol{\omega}|^2,$$

since $\nabla\times\mathbf{v}=\boldsymbol{\omega}$. Hence

$$\boxed{  
\nabla\cdot\mathbf{E}_H = \mathbf{L}\cdot\nabla H + H\big(\mathbf{v}\cdot(\nabla\times\boldsymbol{\omega}) - \boldsymbol{|\omega}|^2\big)= :B_{E,H}}$$

This gives an effective “electric charge density” built from helicity gradients and vorticity structure.

---

## 4) Ampère-like law: $\nabla\times\mathbf{B}_H = \partial_t\mathbf{E}_H + \dots$

Compute

$$\nabla\times\mathbf{B}_H = \nabla\times(H\boldsymbol{\omega})  
= \nabla H\times\boldsymbol{\omega} + H\,\nabla\times\boldsymbol{\omega}.$$

And

$$\partial_t\mathbf{E}_H = \partial_t(H\mathbf{L}) = \mathbf{L}\,\partial_t H + H\,\partial_t\mathbf{L}.$$

So

$$\nabla\times\mathbf{B}_H - \partial_t\mathbf{E}_H  
= \nabla H\times\boldsymbol{\omega} + H\,\nabla\times\boldsymbol{\omega}  
\;-\; \mathbf{L}\,\partial_t H \;-\; H\,\partial_t\mathbf{L}.$$

Group the $H$ terms and non-$H$ derivatives into a current-like object:

$$\boxed{\;  
\nabla\times\mathbf{B}_H = \partial_t\mathbf{E}_H +  
\Big(\nabla H\times\boldsymbol{\omega} - \mathbf{L}\,\partial_t H\Big)  
\;+\; H\big(\nabla\times\boldsymbol{\omega} - \partial_t\mathbf{L}\big).}$$

Call the whole RHS extra piece $\mathbf{J}_H$. This $\mathbf{J}_H$ is the analogue of a free-current term (plus nonlinear/constitutive corrections) and is fully expressible in terms of $\mathbf{v},\boldsymbol{\omega},H$ and their derivatives. One can compute $\partial_t\mathbf{L}$ explicitly if you want the evolution written only in $\mathbf{v}$ and $\boldsymbol{\omega}$; for reference,

$$\partial_t\mathbf{L} = \partial_t(\boldsymbol{\omega}\times\mathbf{v})  
= (\partial_t\boldsymbol{\omega})\times\mathbf{v} + \boldsymbol{\omega}\times(\partial_t\mathbf{v}).$$

---

## 5) Compact Maxwell-like system (with identified sources)

Collecting the four relations:

$$\boxed{\begin{aligned}  
&\nabla\cdot\mathbf{B}_H = \rho_{m,H} = \boldsymbol{\omega}\cdot\nabla H,\\[4pt]  
&\nabla\times\mathbf{E}_H = -\partial_t\mathbf{B}_H + \mathbf{S}_H,\qquad  
\mathbf{S}_H = \nabla H\times\mathbf{L} + \boldsymbol{\omega}\,\partial_t H,\\[4pt]  
&\nabla\cdot\mathbf{E}_H = \rho_{e,H} = \mathbf{L}\cdot\nabla H + H\big(\mathbf{v}\!\cdot\!(\nabla\times\boldsymbol{\omega}) - |\boldsymbol{\omega}|^2\big),\\[4pt]  
&\nabla\times\mathbf{B}_H = \partial_t\mathbf{E}_H + \mathbf{J}_H,  
\end{aligned}}$$

with

$$\mathbf{J}_H = \nabla H\times\boldsymbol{\omega} - \mathbf{L}\,\partial_t H + H\big(\nabla\times\boldsymbol{\omega} - \partial_t\mathbf{L}\big).$$

These are **exact identities** following from the definitions and the vorticity evolution identity, under the assumptions stated. They show precisely which extra terms must vanish for the H-weighted Lamb/vorticity fields to obey Maxwell’s equations.

---

## 6) Important special cases / limits

* **If $H(\mathbf{x},t)$ is spatially _and_ temporally constant** (i.e. $H=$ const), then all terms involving $\nabla H$ and $\partial_t H$ drop out. The system simplifies dramatically:
    
    * $\nabla\cdot\mathbf{B}_H = H\,\nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{\omega}=0$.
    * $\nabla\times\mathbf{E}_H = -\partial_t\mathbf{B}_H$ (exact Faraday law).
    * $\nabla\cdot\mathbf{E}_H = H\big(\mathbf{v}\!\cdot\!(\nabla\times\boldsymbol{\omega}) - |\boldsymbol{\omega}|^2\big)$ — a source term coming purely from flow structure.
    * $\nabla\times\mathbf{B}_H = \partial_t\mathbf{E}_H + H\big(\nabla\times\boldsymbol{\omega} - \partial_t\mathbf{L}\big)$.
    
    So **with $H=$ constant** you get an exact Faraday/solenoidal match and fewer exotic source terms. That suggests regimes where helicity is approximately constant (either by design or in a local region) are promising if you want Maxwell-like behavior.
* **If further $\nabla\times\boldsymbol{\omega}-\partial_t\mathbf{L}=0$** (a constraint on the flow), then $\nabla\times\mathbf{B}_H=\partial_t\mathbf{E}_H+$ simpler current terms. You can try to impose such a constraint as part of your soliton construction (a constitutive or steady-state condition).
* **Weak $H$-gradients and slow $\partial_t H$**: then the extra terms $\mathbf{S}_H$ and the pieces of $\mathbf{J}_H$ are small, and the dynamics are close to Maxwell.

---

## 7) Physical / parity remarks (why helicity converts pseudo to true vectors)

* $\boldsymbol{\omega}$ is an axial (pseudo-)vector; $H=\mathbf{v}\cdot\boldsymbol{\omega}$ is a pseudoscalar (it changes sign under spatial inversion). The product $H\boldsymbol{\omega}$ therefore transforms as a _true_ vector under parity — good, that matches your design where $\mathbf{B}_H$ should be a real vector. Similar parity checks work for $\mathbf{E}_H$. So your intended parity assignments are consistent with the algebra.

---

## 8) Interpretation & next steps

* **Interpretation:** The Maxwell-like laws do appear — but with _constitutive-like_ and source corrections built from helicity gradients and nonlinear vorticity dynamics. Those corrections are natural: you’re mapping strongly nonlinear fluid objects (vorticity, Lamb vector, helicity) into linear-seeming electromagnetic variables. The nonlinearities reappear as effective charges/currents.
* **If you want exact Maxwell equations** for $\mathbf{E}_H,\mathbf{B}_H$ you must either:
    1. **Constrain the flow** so that the extra terms vanish (e.g. $H$ constant; $\nabla\times\boldsymbol{\omega}=\partial_t\mathbf{L}$; etc.), or
    2. **Accept the extra terms** and interpret them as (i) material polarization/magnetization-like sources, or (ii) effective charges/currents of the emergent electrodynamics.
* **Concrete next steps I can do with you:**
    1. Choose a simple model flow (e.g. steady axisymmetric torus soliton ansatz) and compute the fields $\mathbf{E}_H,\mathbf{B}_H$ and the source densities $\rho_{e,H},\rho_{m,H},\mathbf{J}_H,\mathbf{S}_H$ explicitly. This will tell you whether they look Coulomb-like at long range, etc.
    2. Try to impose local constraints that zero the troublesome terms and see whether those constraints are dynamically stable.
    3. Add viscosity/forcing terms and see how the extra terms change (useful for numerical experiments).
    4. Attempt to derive a linearized wave equation for small perturbations of $\mathbf{E}_H,\mathbf{B}_H$ around a background flow.

---

## Short summary

* Defining $\mathbf{E}_H=H\mathbf{L}$ and $\mathbf{B}_H=H\boldsymbol{\omega}$ produces exact identities that look like Maxwell’s equations **plus** explicit nonlinear source/correction terms built out of $\nabla H,\partial_t H,\boldsymbol{\omega},\mathbf{L},\dots$.
* If $H$ is constant (or nearly so), the system becomes much closer to Maxwell: Faraday’s law and $\nabla\cdot\mathbf{B}_H=0$ hold exactly (for incompressible flow), and only remaining terms come from internal vorticity structure.
* I can compute a worked example (e.g. a toroidal soliton profile) to show the emergent fields and forces explicitly. Want me to do that next? If so, tell me whether you prefer a symbolic derivation, a numerical example (I can build a toy numeric velocity field and compute all terms), or an analytic torus ansatz (e.g. Hill’s spherical vortex / Lundquist-like torus).

* * *

**You:**

my view is that the particle is a toroidal tube with helicity contained only inside the tube, with some continuous transition on the torus envelope, leaving only residual helicity out side. I do need that E will reverse direction in the mirror. so at the border of the torus i need to have E coming out when the helicity inside is one direction and coming in when helicity is the other direction

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Ah — now I understand the **precise geometric constraint** you’re imposing:

* Your particle is a **toroidal tube**, not just a point or uniform volume.
* **Helicity $H$ is concentrated inside the tube**, and tapers continuously to nearly zero at the boundary.
* You want the emergent “electric field”

$$\mathbf{E}_H = H \mathbf{L}$$

to **reverse under mirror (parity)** — i.e., electrons ↔ positrons.

* At the torus **boundary**, $\mathbf{E}_H$ must point **outwards** if the internal helicity has one sign, and **inwards** if the helicity is reversed.

Let’s work through how to encode this in your H*L formalism.

---

## 1) Setting up helicity distribution

Let’s denote:

* The toroidal tube by coordinates $(r, \theta, \phi)$ in a standard torus frame: $R$ major radius, $a$ minor radius.
* The helicity scalar $H(\mathbf{x})$ is **axially symmetric** along $\phi$ (toroidal angle), and has a profile along the minor radius $r$:

$$H(r) = H_0 f(r),\quad r\in[0,a]$$

where $f(r)$ is monotonic, e.g. $f(0)=1$ at the core, $f(a)=0$ at the envelope.

* Outside the torus, $H\approx 0$, residual helicity is negligible.

This ensures that **most of your flow helicity is confined inside the tube**, as you want.

---

## 2) Relationship between helicity and $\mathbf{E}_H$ at the boundary

Recall:

$$\mathbf{E}_H = H \mathbf{L} = H (\boldsymbol{\omega} \times \mathbf{v}).$$

At the **boundary of the torus**, $H$ is small but nonzero. To satisfy the mirror-flip property:

1. Flip helicity $H\to -H$ → flip $\mathbf{E}_H\to -\mathbf{E}_H$. ✅
2. Ensure the **Lamb vector $\mathbf{L}$** has the same orientation with respect to the torus geometry for both electron and positron. Then the **sign of $\mathbf{E}_H$ is controlled by $H$**.

This gives exactly the “E coming out/in depending on helicity” effect you want.

---

### 3) How to construct $\mathbf{L}$ in the torus

* Let $\mathbf{v}$ be the **toroidal circulation** along $\phi$ inside the tube.
* Let $\boldsymbol{\omega} = \nabla \times \mathbf{v}$ be mostly **poloidal** (around the minor radius).

Then

$$\mathbf{L} = \boldsymbol{\omega} \times \mathbf{v} \sim \text{radial vector across tube section}.$$

* In other words, $\mathbf{L}$ points **from the torus core outward**.
* Then $\mathbf{E}_H = H \mathbf{L}$ points **out of the torus for positive H**, **into the torus for negative H**. Exactly your desired parity property.

✅ This naturally encodes the **charge reversal under mirror**.

---

## 4) Smooth boundary condition

* Choose $f(r)$ with smooth decay, e.g. a **cosine or Gaussian envelope**:

$$f(r) = \cos^2\Big(\frac{\pi r}{2 a}\Big), \quad 0\le r \le a$$

* Then $H(r) = H_0 f(r)$ ensures:
    * $H$ peaks at the core
    * $H\to 0$ at the torus envelope
    * $\mathbf{E}_H$ gradually decays to zero at the boundary → no sharp discontinuity.
* Flip the sign of $H_0$ → full electron ↔ positron mirror transformation.

---

## 5) Mirror symmetry (electron ↔ positron)

* Spatial inversion: $\mathbf{x} \to -\mathbf{x}$
* Flip helicity: $H \to -H$
* Then $\mathbf{E}_H = H \mathbf{L} \to -H \mathbf{L} = -\mathbf{E}_H$
* $\mathbf{B}_H = H \boldsymbol{\omega} \to -H \boldsymbol{\omega} = -\mathbf{B}_H$ if $\boldsymbol{\omega}$ also inverts under mirror.

Result: **all emergent fields transform correctly**, the sign of charge flips, and emission/absorption rules for your left/right-handed waves follow naturally.

---

## ✅ 6) Summary of construction

1. Toroidal tube coordinates ($r,\theta,\phi$)
2. Toroidal circulation $\mathbf{v}$ along $\phi$
3. Poloidal vorticity $\boldsymbol{\omega}$ around minor radius
4. Helicity profile $H(r)$ peaked inside torus, decaying smoothly to 0 at the boundary
5. $\mathbf{E}_H = H \mathbf{L}$ → naturally points outward for positive helicity, inward for negative helicity
6. Mirror: $H\to -H$ → $\mathbf{E}_H\to -\mathbf{E}_H$, reproducing “charge reversal”

This is a **clean and consistent toroidal particle model**, with fields automatically satisfying your desired parity behavior.

---

If you want, I can **draw a vector diagram of $\mathbf{v},\boldsymbol{\omega},\mathbf{L},\mathbf{E}_H$ in the torus**, showing clearly how the field reverses under helicity flip. That makes the structure immediately visual and easier to reason about for interactions.

Do you want me to do that next?

* * *

**You:**

but i want to have E and B the the free space outside the tori

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Ah, now I see the key point: you want your **toroidal particles** to generate **fields in the surrounding space** — i.e., $\mathbf{E}_H$ and $\mathbf{B}_H$ not just inside the torus but also **propagating into free space**, like a real charge and magnetic field do. This is crucial if you want your model to reproduce long-range forces (Coulomb-like, Biot–Savart-like).

Let’s go step by step on how to make that consistent.

---

## 1) Why the naive $H \mathbf{L}$ vanishes outside the torus

* Inside the torus: $\mathbf{v}$ circulates, $\boldsymbol{\omega} = \nabla \times \mathbf{v}$ exists, $H = \mathbf{v}\cdot \boldsymbol{\omega} \neq 0$, so $\mathbf{E}_H = H \mathbf{L}$ is nonzero.
* Outside the torus: $\mathbf{v}\to 0$, $\boldsymbol{\omega}\to 0$, $H \to 0$ → $\mathbf{E}_H \to 0$.

So, with your current definitions, there is **no field outside**, which doesn’t match the behavior of real electrons/positrons.

---

## 2) Standard trick: multipole-like expansion

To get fields outside:

1. Treat the torus as a **localized “source region”**.
2. Define **effective potentials** at a distance using **Green’s functions** or **far-field expansion**, similar to classical electrodynamics:

$$\mathbf{E}_H(\mathbf{x}) = \int_\text{torus} \frac{\rho_\text{eff}(\mathbf{x}') (\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}')}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'|^3} \, d^3x',$$ $$\mathbf{B}_H(\mathbf{x}) = \int_\text{torus} \frac{\mathbf{J}_\text{eff}(\mathbf{x}') \times (\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}')}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'|^3} \, d^3x',$$

where:

* $\rho_\text{eff} = \nabla \cdot \mathbf{E}_H$ inside the torus
* $\mathbf{J}_\text{eff} = \nabla \times \mathbf{B}_H - \partial_t \mathbf{E}_H$ inside the torus

**Far from the torus**, these integrals give Coulomb-like ($1/r^2$) and Biot–Savart-like ($1/r^2$) fields, even if $\mathbf{E}_H$ and $\mathbf{B}_H$ vanish outside locally.

---

## 3) Smooth helicity “leakage” for direct fields

Another approach, more in the spirit of your H*L/H*ω fields:

* Extend the helicity field $H(\mathbf{x})$ beyond the torus with a **long-range tail**. For example, define a small decay outside:

$$H(\mathbf{x}) \sim H_0 \frac{a^3}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}_0|^3} \quad \text{for } |\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}_0| \gg a$$

* Then even if $\mathbf{L}$ or $\boldsymbol{\omega}$ are mostly confined, the **effective H-weighted field** outside is nonzero.
* Adjust $\mathbf{v}$ and $\boldsymbol{\omega}$ near the torus edge so that the **integral effect** produces outward radial $\mathbf{E}_H$ for electron, inward for positron, reproducing long-range Coulomb-like field.

This is similar to how in classical **magnetized toroidal solenoids**, the field outside is weak but calculable; your H-weighted cross-product gives the right orientation.

---

## 4) Mirror symmetry at long range

* Your earlier requirement: $\mathbf{E}_H$ reverses under helicity flip.
* If $H$ outside is a **direct extension of the helicity inside**, the long-range field automatically flips sign when you flip the torus helicity.
* The decay profile of $H$ ensures a smooth **radial field outside the torus**, pointing outward for electrons, inward for positrons.

---

## 5) Practical implementation

1. Inside torus: keep $\mathbf{E}_H = H \mathbf{L}$, $\mathbf{B}_H = H \boldsymbol{\omega}$.
2. Outside torus: define **effective H-tail** $H_\text{ext}(\mathbf{x})$ using:
    * Gaussian decay: $H_\text{ext}(r) \sim H_0 \exp[-(|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}_0|/R)^2]$
    * Power law: $H_\text{ext}(r) \sim H_0 (a/|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}_0|)^n$, $n=2\text{–}3$ for Coulomb-like
3. Compute outside fields as:

$$\mathbf{E}_H^\text{outside} = H_\text{ext}(\mathbf{x}) \mathbf{L}_\text{boundary}, \quad  
\mathbf{B}_H^\text{outside} = H_\text{ext}(\mathbf{x}) \boldsymbol{\omega}_\text{boundary}.$$

* Choose $\mathbf{L}_\text{boundary}$ and $\boldsymbol{\omega}_\text{boundary}$ so that $\mathbf{E}_H^\text{outside}$ points radially outward (or inward) along the torus axis.

---

## 6) Conceptual summary

* The **toroidal core** carries most helicity → keeps the soliton stable.
* The **smooth boundary / helicity tail** produces **long-range fields** outside.
* The **direction of the fields** automatically reverses under helicity flip (mirror electron ↔ positron).
* You can adjust the **radial profile** of $H_\text{ext}(r)$ to get desired $1/r^2$ Coulomb-like decay.
* This creates a **self-consistent toroidal particle with long-range E and B** in free space, while keeping your H*L/H*ω structure inside.

---

If you want, I can **draw a diagram of this toroidal particle with field lines outside**, showing the transition from strong helicity inside to weak far-field outside, with $\mathbf{E}_H$ radial and reversing under mirror. That usually makes the geometry and field orientation immediately clear.

Do you want me to do that?

* * *

**You:**

is it possible to have E,B depend on the helicity only inside the the torus, but then from continuity to the torus outside, when the helicity dies quickly, maintain the maxwells equations now with only L and W, and still make L point in the right direction (incoming to one part of particle and outgoing from its mirror image particle), and maintain all the maxwells equation features (Poiynting Vector, Energy, waves) but with the tori particles as sources. how would that work?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Ah! Now I see exactly what you’re aiming for: you want a **hybrid construction**:

1. **Core torus:** helicity $H$ is confined inside the particle; $\mathbf{E}_H = H \mathbf{L}$, $\mathbf{B}_H = H \boldsymbol{\omega}$.
2. **Outside the torus:** helicity is essentially zero ($H\to 0$), but you still want **Maxwell’s equations to hold exactly** in free space, with fields generated by the particle acting as **sources**.
3. You want **correct directionality of fields** (outgoing for electron, incoming for positron, consistent with mirror symmetry).
4. You want **full EM features**: $\mathbf{P} = \mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}$, energy density, wave propagation, etc.

We can break this down systematically.

---

## 1) Core idea

* **Inside torus:** $H \neq 0$, $\mathbf{E}_H = H\mathbf{L}$, $\mathbf{B}_H = H\boldsymbol{\omega}$. This is your “helicity-powered source region.”
* **At the torus boundary:** $H\to 0$ continuously. The fields defined as $H\mathbf{L}, H\boldsymbol{\omega}$ **vanish naturally**.

At this point, your “helicity-weighted fields” no longer exist outside.

* **Outside:** We **switch description**: now the fields are purely $\mathbf{L}$ and $\mathbf{W}$ (Lamb vector and vorticity), with no $H$.
* The trick is to treat the **toroid as a source term for the free-space Maxwell equations**.

---

## 2) Using continuity and source matching

* Let’s define free-space fields $(\mathbf{E},\mathbf{B})$ obeying **exact Maxwell’s equations**:

$$\begin{aligned}  
\nabla\cdot\mathbf{E} &= \rho_\text{free},\\  
\nabla\cdot\mathbf{B} &= 0,\\  
\nabla\times\mathbf{E} &= -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t},\\  
\nabla\times\mathbf{B} &= \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t} + \mathbf{J}_\text{free}.  
\end{aligned}$$

* Treat the **toroid as a compact localized source**:

$$\rho_\text{free}(\mathbf{x},t) = \nabla \cdot \mathbf{E}_H^\text{inside},\quad  
\mathbf{J}_\text{free}(\mathbf{x},t) = \nabla \times \mathbf{B}_H^\text{inside} - \partial_t \mathbf{E}_H^\text{inside}.$$

* Then solve Maxwell’s equations in free space with these **compact sources**. Far away, the solution gives Coulomb-like / radiation fields, **independent of H outside**.
* At the torus boundary, impose **continuity conditions**:

$$\mathbf{E}_\text{outside} \cdot \hat{n} = \mathbf{E}_H^\text{inside} \cdot \hat{n},\quad  
\mathbf{B}_\text{outside} \cdot \hat{n} = \mathbf{B}_H^\text{inside} \cdot \hat{n}.$$

This ensures smooth transition: helicity disappears, but Maxwell’s fields continue.

---

## 3) How to orient $\mathbf{L}$ and $\mathbf{W}$ at the boundary

* **Inside:** $\mathbf{L}$ points **outward along radial torus vector**; $\mathbf{W}$ circulates poloidally.
* **Boundary / outside:** Use **Lamb vector and vorticity at the boundary** as “matching condition” to define free-space $\mathbf{E}$ and $\mathbf{B}$.
* The **directionality (incoming/outgoing)** is encoded in the **toroid’s helicity**:
    * Electron torus → $\mathbf{L}$ points out → $\mathbf{E}$ points radially outward.
    * Mirror (positron) → reverse helicity → $\mathbf{L}$ reversed → $\mathbf{E}$ points radially inward.
* Then outside, the fields propagate naturally via Maxwell’s equations (radiation, waves, Poynting vector, etc.).

---

## 4) Summary: stepwise construction

1. **Define particle torus**: helicity $H$, velocity $\mathbf{v}$, vorticity $\boldsymbol{\omega}$. Compute $\mathbf{E}_H = H \mathbf{L}, \mathbf{B}_H = H \mathbf{W}$.
2. **Compute effective sources**: $$\rho_\text{free} = \nabla\cdot \mathbf{E}_H,\quad  
    \mathbf{J}_\text{free} = \nabla\times\mathbf{B}_H - \partial_t \mathbf{E}_H.$$ These are nonzero only inside the torus.
3. **Define free-space Maxwell fields outside**: solve Maxwell’s equations with these sources. At the boundary, fields match the inside H-weighted fields.
4. **Far-field behavior**: gives Coulomb-like radial field and Biot–Savart-like circulation. Energy, Poynting vector, and wave propagation are now exact outside.
5. **Mirror symmetry**: flip H → -H → flips E direction, B remains consistent. Incoming/outgoing orientation is automatic.

✅ Result:

* **Inside torus:** helicity-powered fields H_L/H_W.
* **Outside torus:** ordinary Maxwell fields obeying full wave dynamics.
* **Continuity at boundary:** ensures no discontinuities.
* **Electrons / positrons:** correct outgoing/incoming E-field, all Maxwell features.

---

This is exactly how **soliton models of EM charges** usually reconcile a compact internal structure with standard long-range fields.

---

If you want, I can **draw a full diagram** showing:

* torus particle with helicity inside,
* $\mathbf{E}_H, \mathbf{B}_H$ inside,
* matching $\mathbf{E}, \mathbf{B}$ outside,
* correct radial directions for electron vs positron,
* Poynting vector / field lines in free space.

It usually makes the construction very intuitive.

Do you want me to do that?

* * *

**You:**

i am not sure that all this will get me the L to be pointing inwards or outwards according to the left right helicity? that's why the initial idea was to focus on H*L and H*W. can we change somthing to achieve a reverse in L direction (and W direction) according to helicity sign?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Yes — you _can_ make the Lamb vector $\mathbf{L}$ (and the vorticity orientation that produces it) flip sign together with the helicity. In fact, for the common toroidal ansatz the sign of $\mathbf{L}$ in the torus cross-section is tied directly to the sign of the product $v\cdot\omega$ (i.e. the helicity). So if you set up the internal flows so that reversing the helicity **necessarily** reverses one of the flow components, then $\mathbf{L}$ reverses automatically.

Below I give a concrete, simple torus model (with minimal coordinates and algebra), show exactly why $ \operatorname{sign}(L_r)=\operatorname{sign}(H)$ in that model, and then explain how to make the boundary and outside fields behave smoothly so the outward/inward direction is preserved at the surface and can serve as the source for free-space Maxwell fields.

---

# 1 — A simple torus ansatz (coordinates & fields)

Work in a standard torus frame around the torus center. Use local orthonormal basis for the cross-section:

* $e_\phi$ — toroidal (along the big circle),
* $e_\theta$ — poloidal (around the small circle),
* $e_r$ — radial from the small circle center outward (points from core to envelope).

Assume the dominant flow is toroidal:

$$\mathbf{v}(\mathbf{x}) = v_\phi(r)\,e_\phi,$$

with $r$ the minor-radius coordinate inside the tube ($0\le r\le a$). (Keep $v_\phi$ axisymmetric in $\phi$.)

For such a toroidal flow the dominant vorticity inside the tube is poloidal:

$$\boldsymbol{\omega}(\mathbf{x}) \approx \omega_\theta(r)\,e_\theta,$$

where (up to geometry-dependent factors) $\omega_\theta(r)\simeq \frac{1}{r}\partial_r(r\,v_\phi(r))$. The exact formula picks up metric factors for a real torus, but the sign relation remains the same.

Now compute helicity and Lamb vector:

* Helicity density

$$H = \mathbf{v}\cdot\boldsymbol{\omega} \approx v_\phi(r)\,\omega_\theta(r).$$

* Lamb vector

$$\mathbf{L}=\boldsymbol{\omega}\times\mathbf{v}  
\;\approx\; \omega_\theta(r)\,e_\theta \times v_\phi(r)\,e_\phi  
\;=\; \big[v_\phi(r)\,\omega_\theta(r)\big]\,(e_\theta\times e_\phi).$$

For a right-handed basis $(e_r,e_\theta,e_\phi)$ the cross product $e_\theta\times e_\phi$ equals $+e_r$ (up to sign convention of your coordinate orientation). Thus

$$\boxed{\; \mathbf{L}\approx H\,e_r \;+\;(\text{smaller corrections})\;},$$

i.e. the radial component $L_r$ is proportional to $H$. In particular

$$\operatorname{sign}(L_r)=\operatorname{sign}(H).$$

So: **if you flip the sign of helicity (change $H\to -H$) by reversing either $v_\phi$ or $\omega_\theta$, then $L_r$ flips sign as well** — giving the outward ↔ inward Lamb direction you want.

---

# 2 — How to flip helicity in practice

There are two natural, physically clear ways to flip the sign of $H$:

A. **Reverse the toroidal circulation**  
Set $v_\phi(r)\to -v_\phi(r)$ (keep $\omega_\theta$ the same). Then $H\to -H$ and $\mathbf{L}\to -\mathbf{L}$.

B. **Reverse the poloidal vorticity**  
Change the poloidal circulation so $\omega_\theta(r)\to -\omega_\theta(r)$ while keeping $v_\phi$ direction fixed. Again $H$ and $\mathbf{L}$ flip sign.

Either operation changes the _relative handedness_ of the toroidal vs poloidal flows, which is precisely what helicity measures. Both are local changes inside the torus, so they meet your intuition that charge is a geometric consequence of flow handedness.

---

# 3 — Smooth boundary and continuity to the outside

Your worry that “inside H→0 so L vanishes outside” is addressed by two complementary moves:

1. **Boundary tail for flow / vorticity**  
    Make the toroidal velocity $v_\phi(r)$ decay smoothly to near zero at $r=a$, but arrange the gradient $\partial_r(r v_\phi)$ so that $\omega_\theta(r)$ near the boundary keeps the same sign as inside (just decaying magnitude). For example choose a smooth envelope $f(r)$ with $f(0)=1,\ f(a)=0$ and set

$$v_\phi(r)=V_0\,f(r).$$

Then $\omega_\theta(r)\sim\frac{1}{r}\partial_r(rV_0 f(r))$ also decays but keeps sign determined by $V_0$ and $f$. The product $v_\phi\omega_\theta$ therefore maintains its sign up to the boundary. Thus the radial $L_r$ points outward (or inward) at the boundary according to the core helicity sign.

2. **Define matching conditions for free-space E,B**  
    Treat the region inside the torus as the electromagnetic source (compute $\rho_\text{eff}=\nabla\!\cdot(H\mathbf{L})$, $\mathbf{J}_\text{eff}=\nabla\times(H\boldsymbol{\omega})-\partial_t(H\mathbf{L})$). Solve Maxwell’s equations outside with these compact sources. The boundary values

$$\mathbf{E}_\text{outside}\cdot\hat{n}=\mathbf{E}_H\cdot\hat{n},\qquad  
\mathbf{B}_\text{outside}\times\hat{n}=\mathbf{B}_H\times\hat{n}$$

will then be continuous (or differ only by thin-surface currents if you choose discontinuous tails). Since the sign of $\mathbf{E}_H$ at the boundary is locked to the sign of $H$ via the relation above, the outside field inherits the outward/inward orientation.

So the core idea: keep the _sign_ of the product $v_\phi\omega_\theta$ fixed all the way to the boundary (only the magnitude decays). That guarantees an $\mathbf{L}$ on the surface that points the desired way.

---

# 4 — A concrete smoothly varying example (profile)

To be explicit, pick smooth radial profiles inside the tube:

$$v_\phi(r)=V_0\cos^2\!\big(\tfrac{\pi r}{2a}\big), \qquad 0\le r\le a,$$

so $v_\phi(0)=V_0,\; v_\phi(a)=0$. Then

$$\omega_\theta(r) \approx \frac{1}{r}\frac{d}{dr}\big(r v_\phi(r)\big)$$

is easily computed and has the same sign as $V_0$ (except possibly tiny sign-change near $r=0$ if you choose very pathological shapes — avoid those). Thus $H(r)=v_\phi\omega_\theta$ and $L_r$ keep the sign of $V_0$. Flip $V_0\to -V_0$ to get the mirror particle.

Use a similar smooth sign-preserving tail for helicity $H(r)=H_0 f(r)$ with $f(0)=1$, $f(a)=\varepsilon\ll1$, so inside the torus $H$ is large and outside $H\to 0$. The important thing is _sign preservation_, not magnitude.

---

# 5 — Ensuring outside fields behave like Coulomb / EM

With the boundary Lamb orientation fixed, the rest is standard:

* compute effective $\rho,\mathbf{J}$ inside from $H\mathbf{L},H\boldsymbol{\omega}$;
* solve Maxwell in free space (Green’s functions) — far field will be Coulomb/Biot–Savart like and will keep the sign (incoming/outgoing) dictated by the boundary normal component of $\mathbf{E}_H$.

Thus you do **not** need to make $\mathbf{L}$ itself nonzero arbitrarily far outside — you just need it to have the right sign at the boundary, and that sign is inherited by the outside Maxwell solution.

# 6 — Summary / recipe you can implement now

1. Use toroidal ansatz: $\mathbf{v}=v_\phi(r)e_\phi,\ \boldsymbol{\omega}\approx\omega_\theta(r)e_\theta$.
2. Choose $v_\phi(r)=\pm V_0 f(r)$ with smooth envelope $f(r)$ (cosine/Gaussian) so $v_\phi$ is nonzero in core and decays to 0 at $r=a$. The sign ± picks electron/positron.
3. Compute $\omega_\theta(r)\simeq\frac{1}{r}\partial_r(r v_\phi(r))$. With the above $f$ the sign of $\omega_\theta$ is the same as the sign of $V_0$ (no surprising flips).
4. Then $H=v_\phi\omega_\theta$ and $L_r=H$ (up to orientation convention) so both share the same sign throughout the tube.
5. Use $\mathbf{E}_H=H\mathbf{L}$, $\mathbf{B}_H=H\boldsymbol{\omega}$ inside; compute $\rho_\text{eff},\mathbf{J}_\text{eff}$ and solve Maxwell outside. The outside fields will point outward for one helicity sign and inward for the mirror sign.

If you want, I can:

* compute the explicit formulas for $\omega_\theta(r)$ for the cosine profile above and write out $H(r)$ and $L_r(r)$ symbolically, or
* make a surface plot/sketch showing vectors $v,\omega,L$ in a torus cross-section so you can visually verify the orientation, or
* set up the Green’s-function integrals for the outside $\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{x})$ and show the leading multipole (monopole/dipole) falloff.

Which of those should I do next? (If you prefer, I’ll just produce the symbolic $\omega_\theta$, $H$, $L_r$ expressions for the cosine envelope right away.)
